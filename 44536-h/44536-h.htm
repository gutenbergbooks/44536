<p class="first">As the first attempt to translate into English any
part of the varied and interesting secular literature of the Georgian
people, this little book may perhaps claim some attention from the
public. A volume of sermons by Bishop Gabriel of Kuta&iuml;s was
published by the Rev. S. C. Malan in 1867, but, with this single
exception, I do not know of any other work in the Iberian tongue which
has been offered to English readers. The state of comparative neglect
into which Oriental studies in general have fallen of late among us,
the rulers of the East, accounts, to some extent, for this fact; it is
to be hoped that an improvement in this respect may soon be
apparent.</p>
<p>Some years ago, a book written by my brother<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e228src" href="#xd21e228" name="xd21e228src">1</a> first excited
my interest in the Caucasus and its brave and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e233" href="#xd21e233" name=
"xd21e233">viii</a>]</span>beautiful inhabitants. A study of the
classical literature, especially of the great epic poet, Shota
Rusthaveli, of the twelfth century, has profitably occupied much of my
time during the past two years, and it is my intention to give my
countrymen an early opportunity of sharing in the pleasure I have
derived therefrom.</p>
<p>As a relaxation from these more arduous studies, I amused myself by
turning into English the originals of the following stories. I showed
the manuscript to Dr. E. B. Tylor, who told me that it presented many
features of interest to folklorists, and advised me to publish it; it
is, therefore, fitting that I should dedicate the book to the creator
of the modern science of anthropology, and he has kindly given me
permission to do so.</p>
<p>The geographical position of Georgia, a region lying between East
and West, forming a bridge along which a great part of the traffic in
ideas as well as in commodities must pass, makes it a rich field of
inquiry for the student. By their religious and political connection
with Byzantium on the one hand, and by their constant intercourse with
Persia and Turkey on the other, the Iberians have gained much from both
Christendom and Islam, and among them may yet be found lost links in
several chains of historical and literary investigations. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb.ix" href="#pb.ix" name="pb.ix">ix</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sources from which I have taken the stories are the
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>Part <span class="sc">I</span>. is a collection edited by Mr.
Aghniashvili, and published in Tiflis, in 1891, by the Georgian
Folklore Society, under the title, <i lang="ka-latn">Khalkhuri
Zghaprebi</i>.</p>
<p>Part <span class="sc">II</span>. comprises the Mingrelian stories in
Professor A. A. Tsagareli&rsquo;s <i lang="ru-latn">Mingrelskie Etyudy,
S. Pbg.</i>, 1880 (in Mingrelian and Russian).</p>
<p>These were collected by Professor Tsagareli during the years
1876&ndash;79, chiefly in the districts of Sachichuo and Salipartiano,
which lie almost in the centre of Mingrelia, far removed from foreign
influence, and are famous for the purity of their Mingrelian idiom. The
Mingrelian dialect is rapidly being replaced by pure Georgian
throughout the country.</p>
<p>Part <span class="sc">III</span>. is an anonymous collection,
entitled <i lang="ru-latn">Gruzinskiya Narodnyya Skazki. Sobr. Bebur
B.<sup>*</sup> S. Pbg</i>., 1884.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It will be found that, besides the differences due to geographical
position, the three groups of stories are not of the same character.
Part <span class="sc">II</span>. is more na&iuml;ve and popular than
Part <span class="sc">I</span>., and Part <span class="sc">III</span>.
exhibits more appreciation of the ridiculous than the rest of the book,
and is of a more didactic nature. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e284" href="#xd21e284" name="xd21e284">x</a>]</span></p>
<p>The points of resemblance between the following stories and those
quoted by the late Mr. Ralston, in his well-known <i>Russian Folk
Tales</i>, are so numerous, and so apparent, that I have not thought it
necessary to refer to them in the notes.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I must express my thanks to Prince Ivan&eacute;
Machabeli, of Tiflis, the Georgian translator of Shakespeare, for his
kindness in reading my proofs, and to my brother, who did the Russian
part of the work for me.</p>

<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a poor peasant who had one
son. And it came to pass that his wife said to him: &lsquo;He should
learn some trade, for when he is separated from thee, what will he do
if he is left ignorant like thee?&rsquo; The wife importuned him; she
gave him no rest. So the peasant took his child, and went to seek a
master for him. On the way they were thirsty. He saw a rivulet, drank
eagerly till his thirst was quenched, and when he lifted up his head he
cried out: &lsquo;Ah! how good thou art!&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e805src" href="#xd21e805" name="xd21e805src">1</a> On saying this,
there came forth from the water a devil in the form of a man, and said
to the peasant: &lsquo;What dost thou want, O man! I am Vakhraca; what
troubles thee?&rsquo; The peasant told him all his story. The devil,
when he learnt this, said: &lsquo;Give me this son of thine: I will
teach him for one year, then come hither; if thou knowest him, it is
well, he will go with thee; if not, he is mine and mine alone, he shall
be lost to thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now this devil had other children to bring up on the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>same
conditions; and, since in a year children change so much that their
parents may no longer know them, the devil always had the best of it.
The peasant knew nothing about this; he agreed to the proposal, and
went home. A year passed by, and the father of the child came to the
devil; he did not find the devil at home. He saw in the courtyard a
multitude of boys, and looked again and again, but could not recognise
his boy. He was sad. However, his own son came up and knew him. Then
the boy said: &lsquo;Presently my instructor will come; he will turn us
all into doves, and we shall fly away; in the flight I shall fly before
all, and in the return I shall be behind all; and when my master asks
thee which is thy son, thou wilt point to me.&rsquo; The peasant
rejoiced, and awaited the master with a hopeful heart. In a little
while the master appeared. He called his pupils, turned them into
doves, and ordered them to fly away. The peasant&rsquo;s son flew
before all, and when they returned remained behind. The master
inquired: &lsquo;Now, dost thou know which is thy son?&rsquo; The
peasant pointed him out. The devil was enraged when he perceived the
trick his pupil had played him, but what did it matter! The boy left
him.</p>
<p>The father went and took his son with him. They came to a place
where nobles were hunting: some greyhounds were pursuing a hare, but
they could not catch it. The boy said to his father: &lsquo;Go thou
into the wood, raise a hare. I will turn into a hound, and will seize
it before the eyes of these nobles. The nobles will follow thee, and
will be anxious to buy me. Ask a high price, and sell me to them. Then
I shall seize the first opportunity to escape, and overtake thee on the
road.&rsquo; The father went into the wood and started a hare; his son
turned into a hound, pursued the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3"
href="#pb3" name="pb3">3</a>]</span>hare, and, just before the eyes of
the nobles, he pounced on it. They crowded round the peasant, and
insisted upon buying the dog. The peasant asked a high price, which
they paid in exchange for the hound. The nobles attached a cord to the
dog, and went away. When they had travelled a little way along the road
a hare started from the thicket. They let the hound loose, and sent him
after it. When he had chased the hare a long way, and had lost sight of
the nobles, he changed again into a boy, and followed his father.</p>
<p>The father and son went on their way; the money seemed inadequate.
&lsquo;I must get some more,&rsquo; said the son. They looked round;
another party of nobles were pursuing a pheasant; the falcons flew
after it, but for some reason could not catch it. The boy changed
himself into a falcon, and sported with the pheasant in the air, just
before the nobles&rsquo; eyes. He brought it down; they were frantic
with pleasure, and said to the peasant: &lsquo;Thou must sell this
falcon to us.&rsquo; The peasant again fixed a high price, to which the
nobles agreed, and this they paid him in exchange for the falcon. The
peasant went on his way. The nobles, after travelling some distance,
sent the falcon in pursuit of another pheasant. The falcon flew after
the bird, and, when he was out of the nobles&rsquo; sight, changed into
a boy and joined his father.</p>
<p>The father and son went on with their money, but the son was not
content with it. He said to his father: &lsquo;Come, I will change into
a splendid horse; mount me, go into a town and sell me. But remember
not to sell me to a man with variegated eyes; if thou dost, do not give
him the bridle, for then, thou knowest, I shall not be able to free
myself from his hands.&rsquo; On saying this, the boy changed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>into a splendid, spirited horse, his father mounted
and rode into the town. Here he saw many who wanted to buy it, but more
eager than any was a man with variegated eyes. Whenever any one added a
<i lang="ka-latn">manethi</i> (rouble) to the price, he added a
<i lang="ka-latn">thuman</i> (ten roubles). Love of money conquered the
peasant, and he sold the horse to the man with variegated eyes. He
bought the bridle with it, mounted the horse and spurred it on. He
went, disappeared, and could no longer contain his joy that he had his
pupil once more in his power. He reached home, shut the horse in a dark
room, and locked the door. His pupil lay down and was sad; he thought
and grieved, but there seemed to be no help for him; time passed, and
he could contrive no means of escape.</p>
<p>One day he noticed that a sunbeam entered the stable through a hole.
He changed himself into a mouse and ran out. His master saw him,
however, and pursued him as a cat. The mouse ran, the cat followed.
Just when the cat was about to seize him in his mouth, the mouse turned
into a fish swimming in a stream. The master turned into a net and
followed him; the fish swam away, but the net came after him. Just when
the net was going to cover him, the fish changed into a pheasant and
flew away. The master pursued him as a falcon. The pheasant flew on and
the falcon followed. When the falcon was about to put its claws into
him, he turned into a red apple, and rolled into the king&rsquo;s lap.
The falcon changed into a knife in the king&rsquo;s hand. Just when the
king was going to cut the apple, it changed into a <i>codi</i> (80
lbs.) of millet spread on a cloth. The devil changed himself into a
brood-hen, and began to eat it. When it had eaten almost all, and only
left one grain, this grain turned into a needle, and rolled in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>front of the hen, which changed into a thread in the
eye of the needle. As it was about to hold back the needle, the needle
ran into the fire and burned the thread. The boy thus escaped from the
devil, went home to his father, and lived happily ever
afterwards.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e837src" href="#xd21e837" name=

<p class="first">Once upon a time there was a peasant who had three
daughters. This man&rsquo;s wife was dead, so he took to himself
another. The stepmother hated the girls like the plague. Every day she
bothered her husband, saying: &lsquo;Take away these daughters of
thine, and get rid of them.&rsquo; Sometimes she yielded to their
father&rsquo;s entreaties, sometimes she gave way to her dislike. At
last she could bear it no longer: she became ill, went to bed, took
with her crisp, flat bread, and began to moan. She turned on one side,
made the loaves crack, and cried out: &lsquo;My sides are breaking. Oh!
turn me on my other side!&rsquo; The cause of all this was her
stepdaughters, so her husband, seeing that nothing was to be done,
consented to get rid of them.</p>
<p>He went away into the forest. There he saw a large apple-tree
bearing fruit; underneath it he dug a deep hole, took an apple for
each, and went home. When he came in, he gave each her apple. The girls
liked the taste of the apples, and said to their father: &lsquo;Where
didst thou find these? canst thou not bring some more?&rsquo; The
father replied: &lsquo;There are many of these apples in the forest,
but I have not time to bring more. If you like, you can come
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>with me; I will shake them down, you can gather them
up and bring them away.&rsquo; The girls were delighted, and went with
their father.</p>
<p>Their father had secretly covered up the hole, and said to the
girls: &lsquo;Here are the apples. I will shake them down, but until I
tell you do not gather them up. Then, when I speak, you can all
scramble for them, and whoever picks up an apple, it is hers.&rsquo;
The father went up to the tree, and when he had shaken it well, called
out to his daughters: &lsquo;Now, catch who can!&rsquo; The girls
suddenly rushed on to the covering, which could not bear their weight;
it fell into the hole, taking with it the three girls. Their father
threw them in a great many apples, left them, and went away.</p>
<p>The girls could not at first understand their father&rsquo;s
conduct, but then they saw that he had brought them into the wood on
purpose, and said: &lsquo;Our wicked stepmother is to blame for
this!&rsquo; but there was no help for it, so these three little
maidens sat down and wept. They wept and wept until their faces were
pale; their tears shook heaven above and the earth beneath. At last the
apples were finished. They thought and thought, and decided that each
should let blood from her little finger, and that they should eat her
whose blood tasted sweetest. They let blood, and it was agreed by all
that the youngest sister&rsquo;s was sweetest. She said: &lsquo;O
sisters! do not eat me. I have three apples hidden; eat them, and
perhaps God will help us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she bent on her knees, and prayed to God: &lsquo;O God, for Thy
name&rsquo;s sake, I beseech Thee, let one of my hands turn into a
pickaxe, and the other into a shovel.&rsquo; God heard her prayer. One
of her hands changed into a pickaxe, and the other into a shovel. With
one hand she dug <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>a hole, and with the other shovelled away the earth.
She dug and dug until she came to a mouse&rsquo;s hole. She took thence
nuts, little nuts, and gave them to her sisters. She went on digging,
and broke down a stable wall. This stable belonged to the king, and
almonds and raisins were strewed about in it. The girls used to go to
the stable; they stole the almonds and raisins, and ate them. The
grooms were astonished, and said: &lsquo;Who can it be that steals the
almonds and raisins? The horses are dying of starvation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The little maiden, in her digging, next broke the window of an old
woman&rsquo;s hut. Every morning the mistress of this hut went to mass.
Feeling sorry for the old woman, the girls stole into the hut, cleaned
and tidied everything, put beans on the fire to cook, broke off
sufficient bread for themselves, and stole away again. When the old
woman came home she was filled with surprise. Who could have been there
and stolen her bread? Perhaps she could find out. She did not go to
mass next day. She rolled herself in a mat, and stuck herself up, like
a stick, near the door. The girls came; they thought the old woman had
gone to mass, and stole into the hut one by one. The old woman watched
from the mat with both her eyes, and she could scarcely believe what
she saw. She saw the three maidens enter&mdash;each more beautiful than
the other, all fair, as if the sun had never frowned upon them. She
gazed and gazed until she could bear it no longer: she threw off the
mat, seized one of them in her arms, and said: &lsquo;Who art thou, who
art so angelic? Art thou human or an angel?&rsquo; The maiden replied:
&lsquo;We are three sisters, we are human. Thus and thus has it
befallen us.&rsquo; And she told their tale to the old woman, who was
delighted that she had found the three sisters. She guarded them as the
light of her eyes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>and, when she went out, turned up baskets over them,
that none should see them and take them away.</p>
<p>Once the woman went to mass. She left the girls under baskets, and
shut the doors. Then the idea came into the girls&rsquo; heads that
they would like some raisins. They rose, took off the baskets, and
crept into the stable. Just as they were beginning to steal raisins,
the groom hastened in<span class="corr" id="xd21e868" title=
"Not in source">,</span> seized the three sisters, and took them before
the king. The king asked them who they were, and they told him all
their history. The king said: &lsquo;Tell me, what can you do?&rsquo;
The eldest sister said: &lsquo;I can weave such a carpet that every man
in thy army could sit on it, and still half of it would not be
unrolled.&rsquo; The second sister said: &lsquo;I can cook enough food
in an egg-shell to feed thine army, and when they have eaten, half yet
shall remain.&rsquo; The king said to the youngest: &lsquo;What canst
thou do?&rsquo; She replied: &lsquo;I can bear golden-haired
boys.&rsquo; The king was pleased with this answer, and wedded her. He
tried her sisters&rsquo; skill, but the eldest could not weave a carpet
large enough for one man, while the food cooked by the second sister
would not have satisfied a bird. The king waxed wroth, and said to his
wife: &lsquo;If thou deceivest me too, none of you shall
live.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some time passed, and the youngest sister was with child. At that
time the king&rsquo;s enemy came against him, and he prepared to go
forth to battle. Before he set out he left this message: &lsquo;If my
wife bears a son, let a sword be suspended over the door; if she bears
a daughter, let a spinning-wheel be hung up.&rsquo; Shortly after this
his wife went to bed. Her sisters would allow no one to enter the
bed-room; they tended her and nursed her themselves.</p>
<p>The king&rsquo;s wife brought forth a golden-haired boy. Her
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>two sisters were angry that their youngest sister
should be proved truthful in the sight of the king, while they were
liars; they wished her also to appear untruthful. They arose, and,
without the mother&rsquo;s knowledge, took away the golden-haired boy,
and put in his place a puppy dog. They did not dare to kill the child,
so they made a box, laid him in it, and put it in a river. The river
carried it away, and it stuck in a mill-race. The race was dammed up
and the mill stopped. The miller came out, and saw the box fixed in the
race; he took it up and opened it. Behold, there lay a golden-haired
child! He was childless, so he took it home and brought it up. In the
meantime the sisters hung up a pestle over the door. The king returned
from the battle and saw the pestle. He was very much surprised, and
said: &lsquo;What does this mean? what has my wife brought
forth?&rsquo; They said: &lsquo;A puppy.&rsquo; The king was very
angry, but thought: &lsquo;Perhaps some one has done this; I will wait
and see if she has a son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A year passed, and his wife was again with child. One day, when the
king was out hunting, a golden-haired boy was born. The sisters, as
before, would allow no one in the room. They took the child away
secretly, and put a kitten in its place. They again put the child in a
box in the river, and the miller found it again. The sisters hung the
pestle over the door. When the king returned from the chase, and saw
the pestle, he burned with fires of rage, and sparks shot from his
eyes. He took his wife out, caused her to be wrapped in a
bullock&rsquo;s skin, and bound to a column in front of the palace.
Every one who passed by was ordered to spit in her face and strike her.
Thus unjustly did he torture an innocent being! The miller loved the
two golden-haired children as if they were the apple of his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>eye. They became very wise, brave, and handsome,
and grew as much in a day as other children grow in a year.</p>
<p>Once when the king was out hunting, he saw a group of children
playing, but among them were two who far excelled the others. The king
was very much taken with these two children, and could not withdraw his
eyes from them. He looked and looked, and would never have been tired
of looking; he wished to gaze on them for ever. He noticed how strongly
they resembled himself. He was astonished, and said to himself:
&lsquo;Who can these children be, who are so like myself?&rsquo; But he
could not guess the truth. Just then, while playing, the cap fell from
the head of one of the brothers, and showed his golden hair. The king
was struck, and inquired: &lsquo;Whose children are these?&rsquo; He
was told they were the miller&rsquo;s sons.</p>
<p>The next day the king gave a banquet, and invited the miller and his
golden-haired sons. When the children came into the king&rsquo;s
courtyard, they saw a woman bound to a column, and they looked long,
and knew that this must be their mother. The cook was roasting a
pheasant. The elder brother went inside, took the spit from the cook,
sat down by the fireside, and turned the pheasant round. When it became
red and was cooked, he began to tell a tale. All ears were pricked up,
and the people looked into his face. The boy began to tell his
mother&rsquo;s tale. After he had told how his mother bore the
golden-haired boys, and how the sisters were so treacherous, he
concluded by saying: &lsquo;If this story is true, the bullock&rsquo;s
skin will burst, and my mother be free.&rsquo; And the bullock&rsquo;s
skin burst, and his mother came in.</p>
<p>When the story was quite finished, his younger brother came in and
took the spit in his hand, and said: &lsquo;If all my <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>brother&rsquo;s tale is true and this is indeed
our mother, this roast pheasant will have feathers and fly away.&rsquo;
Feathers appeared on the roast pheasant, and it flew off. The people
gazed open-mouthed. The astonished king commanded the jealous sisters
to be brought, bound them to horses&rsquo; tails, and had them dragged
about. The king took his wife and children into the palace, and
rejoiced greatly that he had learnt the truth and found his
golden-haired sons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e890src" href="#xd21e890"

<h2 class="label">III</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Good-for-nothing</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a good-for-nothing man, who had a
shrewish wife. This wife would give him no rest. She importuned him,
saying: &lsquo;Thou must go away, travel forth and seek for something;
thou seest how poor we are.&rsquo; At last the husband could no longer
bear her reproaches, so he arose and went.</p>
<p>He went forth, he himself knew not whither he was going.</p>
<p>He travelled on, and when he had ascended the ninth mountain from
where he started, he saw a large house, and in this house <i>devis</i>
dwelt. He came near and saw in the middle of the room a fire, round
which the <i>devis</i> were sitting, warming their hands. He went in
and spoke in a friendly manner to them, and sat down by the fire. The
<i>devis</i> treated him well, for he had spoken them fair. He stayed
with them by day and by night; he ate with them, he drank with them, he
slept with them; he was like their youngest brother.</p>
<p>These <i>devis</i> possessed a wishing-stone. When they were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>assembled together, they took out the stone: if
they wished for dinner, dinner appeared; if they wanted supper, they
wished for supper, and lo! what they wished for heartily appeared
before their eyes. They lived thus without care, they had no kind of
sorrow, and this was just what our good-for-nothing liked; he approved
of this life, and wanted to steal the wishing-stone.</p>
<p>Once when the <i>devis</i> were in a deep sleep, the
good-for-nothing silently stole out of the bedroom, took the
wishing-stone, and came to the door. He wished the door to open, and
sure enough it began to creak. It creaked and called out: &lsquo;The
guest has stolen the wishing-stone.&rsquo; The good-for-nothing turned
back, put the stone in its place, went into the bedroom, and pretended
to be asleep. The creaking of the door awoke the <i>devis</i>; they
jumped up and looked; they found the wishing-stone in its place, and
the good-for-nothing in a sweet slumber. They rejoiced, closed the
door, and went to sleep again. When they had fallen into a profound
sleep, the good-for-nothing rose up, took the stone, came to the door,
and, when he wished it to open, it began to creak out: &lsquo;The guest
has stolen the wishing-stone.&rsquo; The good-for-nothing turned back,
again put the wishing-stone in its place, went into the bedroom and
began to snore as if he were asleep. The <i>devis</i> awoke and looked,
but the stone was in its place, and the good-for-nothing snoring. They
were surprised, but shut the door, and went to sleep. The
good-for-nothing did this trick over and over again. The <i>devis</i>
were angry, and furiously jumped up, pulled down the door, and put it
in the fire. When the door was burned, and the <i>devis</i> slept
again, the good-for-nothing rose up, put the wishing-stone in his
pocket, and left the house. The next morning, when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>the
<i>devis</i> awoke, they saw that neither the good-for-nothing nor the
wishing-stone was there any longer. They looked everywhere, but could
not tell whether heaven or earth had swallowed them, so they learnt
nothing.</p>
<p>The good-for-nothing went on his way joyfully; he no longer had any
care or thought; he rejoiced that now he could live without trouble. He
went on, and met on the road a man with a big stick. This man said:
&lsquo;Brother, give me something to eat.&rsquo; The good-for-nothing
put his hand in his pocket, and took out the wishing-stone. He wished,
and there appeared before them everything ready for eating. When they
had finished their meal, the man with the stick said: &lsquo;Come, I
will exchange my stick with thee for this stone.&rsquo; &lsquo;What is
the use of thy stick?&rsquo; inquired the good-for-nothing. &lsquo;If
any one stretches out his hand and calls, &ldquo;Out, stick!&rdquo; the
stick will fall upon the person in front of its master.&rsquo; The
good-for-nothing made the exchange, and went away a short distance;
then he said, &lsquo;Out, stick!&rsquo; and stretched it out towards
its former master. It struck him until all his bones were made soft.
When he had been well beaten, the good-for-nothing came, took his
stone, and went on his way with the stick.</p>
<p>He went on and saw a man with a sword, who said: &lsquo;Brother,
give me something to eat.&rsquo; The good-for-nothing took out his
wishing-stone, and immediately meat and drink appeared before them.
When he had eaten sufficiently, the man said: &lsquo;Come, I will give
thee this sword in exchange for the stone.&rsquo; &lsquo;What is the
use of thy sword?&rsquo; inquired the good-for-nothing. &lsquo;Whoever
possesses it can, if he choose, cut off a hundred thousand
heads.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He exchanged his wishing-stone for the sword, and went away. After
waiting a short time, he said, &lsquo;Out, stick!&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>and
pointed to the former owner of the sword. The stick approached and beat
the man mercilessly. Then the good-for-nothing took the wishing-stone
and went away.</p>
<p>He went on again until he met a man with a piece of felt, who said:
&lsquo;Brother, give me something to eat.&rsquo; The good-for-nothing
man took out his wishing-stone, wished, and immediately a delicious
repast appeared. When he had eaten all he wanted, the man said:
&lsquo;Come, I will give thee my felt in exchange for this
stone.&rsquo; &lsquo;What is the use of thy felt?&rsquo; inquired the
good-for-nothing. &lsquo;If a man&rsquo;s head is cut off, one only has
to take a piece of this felt and apply it; his head will stick on
again, and he will live.&rsquo; The good-for-nothing gave him the
stone, took the felt, and went away. When he had gone a little way, he
said, &lsquo;Out, stick!&rsquo; and the stick beat the man till he was
like a wrinkled quince. The good-for-nothing took his stone and
travelled on.</p>
<p>At last he came to his home. He placed the stick behind the door,
greeted his wife and spoke thus: &lsquo;Wife, see what I have
brought,&rsquo; and he showed her the sword, felt, and wishing-stone.
His wife looked on him with contempt, opened her mouth, and cast all
the dirt in the world on his head. The good-for-nothing bore it till he
could bear it no longer, so he called, &lsquo;Out, stick!&rsquo; The
stick beat her wofully. Then he made his little children sit down, took
out his wishing-stone, wished the table to be laid, and the rarest
delicacies were placed on the cloth. They enjoyed their dinner, while
the beaten wife silently looked down and sulked. She bore it for a
time, but at last she could bear it no longer, and came and embraced
her husband&rsquo;s knees. Her husband forgave her, and they caressed
one another lovingly.</p>
<p>After some time, this wishing-stone made him quite rich,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>so that all their dishes were made of gold. Once
the wife said to her husband: &lsquo;Thou must invite the king and give
him a great banquet.&rsquo; Her husband said: &lsquo;Dost thou not
know, the king is an envious man; when he sees these things, he will
take them from us, and put us in prison.&rsquo; His wife pleaded and
whined until her husband consented.</p>
<p>They invited the king, and made ready a magnificent banquet. When
the feast was finished, the king demanded the wishing-stone. The
good-for-nothing said he could not spare it. The king was enraged, and
sent his whole army to take it away by force. &lsquo;This will not do
at all,&rsquo; said the good-for-nothing to himself; &lsquo;since they
are going to try and force me, I shall show my strength.&rsquo; While
he spoke, he pointed the sword at the army, and the stick at the king.
The heads of all the army were cut off, and the stick beat the envious
king.</p>
<p>The king begged and prayed for mercy: &lsquo;Only bring my soldiers
back to life again, and I swear I will leave thee in peace.&rsquo; Then
the good-for-nothing arose, took the felt and laid a piece on the neck
of each soldier, and the army was restored to life. The king no longer
dared to show his enmity, the good-for-nothing&rsquo;s wife obeyed him
in everything, and they lived happily ever afterwards.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Frog&rsquo;s Skin</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There were once three brothers who wished to marry.
They said: &lsquo;Let us each shoot an arrow, and each shall take his
wife from the place where the arrow falls.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>They
shot their arrows; those of the two elder brothers fell on
noblemen&rsquo;s houses, while the youngest brother&rsquo;s arrow fell
in a lake. The two elder brothers led home their noble wives, and the
youngest went to the shore of the lake. He saw a frog creep out of the
lake and sit down upon a stone. He took it up and carried it back to
the house. All the brothers came home with what fate had given them;
the elder brothers with the noble maidens, and the youngest with a
frog.</p>
<p>The brothers went out to work, the wives prepared the dinner, and
attended to all their household duties; the frog sat by the fire
croaking, and its eyes glittered. Thus they lived together a long time
in love and harmony.</p>
<p>At last the sisters-in-law wearied of the sight of the frog; when
they swept the house, they threw out the frog with the dust. If the
youngest brother found it, he took it up in his hand; if not, the frog
would leap back to its place by the fire and begin to croak. The noble
sisters did not like this, and said to their husbands: &lsquo;Drive
this frog out, and get a real wife for your brother.&rsquo; Every day
the brothers bothered the youngest. He replied, saying: &lsquo;This
frog is certainly my fate, I am worthy of no better, I must be faithful
to it.&rsquo; His sisters-in-law persisted in telling their husbands
that the brother and his frog must be sent away, and at last they
agreed.</p>
<p>The young brother was now left quite desolate: there was no one to
make his food, no one to stand watching at the door. For a short time a
neighbouring woman came to wait upon him, but she had no time, so he
was left alone. The man became very melancholy.</p>
<p>Once when he was thinking sadly of his loneliness, he went to work.
When he had finished his day&rsquo;s labour, he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>went
home. He looked into his house and was struck with amazement. The
sideboard was well replenished; in one place was spread a cloth, and on
the cloth were many different kinds of tempting viands. He looked and
saw the frog in its place croaking. He said to himself that his
sisters-in-law must have done this for him, and went to his work again.
He was out all day working, and when he came home he always found
everything prepared for him.</p>
<p>Once he said to himself: &lsquo;I will see for once who is this
unseen benefactor, who comes to do good to me and look after me.&rsquo;
That day he stayed at home; he seated himself on the roof of the house
and watched. In a short time the frog leaped out of the fireplace,
jumped over to the doors, and all round the room; seeing no one there,
it went back and took off the frog&rsquo;s skin, put it near the fire,
and came forth a beautiful maiden, fair as the sun; so lovely was she
that man could not imagine anything prettier. In the twinkling of an
eye she had tidied everything, prepared the food and cooked it. When
everything was ready, she went to the fire, put on the skin again, and
began to croak. When the man saw this he was very much astonished; he
rejoiced exceedingly that God had granted him such happiness. He
descended from the roof, went in, caressed his frog tenderly, and then
sat down to his tasty supper.</p>
<p>The next day the man hid himself in the place where he had been the
day before. The frog, having satisfied itself that nobody was there,
stripped off its skin and began its good work. This time the man stole
silently into the house, seized the frog&rsquo;s skin in his hand and
threw it into the fire. When the maiden saw this she entreated him, she
wept&mdash;she said: &lsquo;Do not burn it, or thou shalt surely be
destroyed&rsquo;<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>&mdash;but the man had burnt it in a moment.
&lsquo;Now, if thy happiness be turned to misery, it is not my
fault,&rsquo; said the sorrow-stricken woman.</p>
<p>In a very short time the whole country-side knew that the man who
had a frog now possessed in its place a lovely woman, who had come to
him from heaven.</p>
<p>The lord of the country heard of this, and wished to take her from
him. He called the beautiful woman&rsquo;s husband to him and said:
&lsquo;Sow a barnful of wheat in a day, or give me thy wife.&rsquo;
When he had spoken thus, the man was obliged to consent, and he went
home melancholy.</p>
<p>When he went in he told his wife what had taken place. She
reproached him, saying: &lsquo;I told thee what would happen if thou
didst burn the skin, and thou didst not heed me; but I will not blame
thee. Be not sad; go in the morning to the edge of the lake from which
I came, and call out: &ldquo;Mother and Father! I pray you, lend me
your swift bullocks&rdquo;&mdash;lead them away with thee, and the
bullocks will in one day plough the fields and sow the grain.&rsquo;
The husband did this.</p>
<p>He went to the edge of the lake and called out: &lsquo;Mother and
Father! I entreat you, lend me your swift bullocks to-day.&rsquo; There
came forth from the lake such a team of oxen as was never seen on sea
or land.</p>
<p>The youth drove the bullocks away, came to his lord&rsquo;s fields,
and ploughed and sowed them in one day.</p>
<p>His lord was very much surprised. He did not know if there was
anything impossible to this man, whose wife he wanted. He called him a
second time, and said: &lsquo;Go and gather up the wheat thou hast
sown, that not a grain may be wanting, and that the barn may be full.
If thou dost not this, thy wife is mine.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;This is impossible,&rsquo; said the man to himself. He went
home to his wife, who again reproached him, and then said: &lsquo;Go to
the lake&rsquo;s edge and ask for the jackdaws.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The husband went to the edge of the lake and called out:
&lsquo;Mother and Father! I beg you to lend me your jackdaws
to-day.&rsquo; From the lake came forth flocks of jackdaws; they flew
to the ploughed ground, each gathered up a seed and put it into the
barn.</p>
<p>The lord came and cried out: &lsquo;There is one seed short; I know
each one, and one is missing.&rsquo; At that moment a jackdaw&rsquo;s
caw was heard; it came with the missing seed, but owing to a lame foot
it was a little late.</p>
<p>The lord was very angry that even the impossible was possible to
this man, and could not think what to give him to do.</p>
<p>He puzzled his brain until he thought of the following plan. He
called the man and said to him: &lsquo;My mother, who died in this
village, took with her a ring. If thou goest to the other world and
bringest that ring hither to me, it is well; if not, I shall take away
thy wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man said to himself: &lsquo;This is quite impossible.&rsquo; He
went home and complained to his wife. She reproached him, and then
said: &lsquo;Go to the lake and ask for the ram.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The husband went to the lake and called out: &lsquo;Mother and
Father! give me your ram to-day, I pray you.&rsquo; From the lake there
came forth a ram with twisted horns; from its mouth issued a flame of
fire. It said to the man: &lsquo;Mount on my back!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man sat down, and, quick as lightning, the ram descended towards
the lower regions. It went on and shot like an arrow through the
earth.</p>
<p>They travelled on, and saw in one place a man and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>woman
sitting on a bullock&rsquo;s skin, which was not big enough for them,
and they were like to fall off. The man called out to them: &lsquo;What
can be the meaning of this, that this bullock skin is not big enough
for two people?&rsquo; They said: &lsquo;We have seen many pass by like
thee, but none has returned. When thou comest back we shall answer thy
question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went on their way and saw a man and woman sitting on an
axe-handle, and they were not afraid of falling. The man called out to
them: &lsquo;Are you not afraid of falling from the handle of an
axe?&rsquo; They said to him: &lsquo;We have seen many pass by like
thee, but none has returned. When thou comest back we shall answer thy
question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They went on their way again, until they came to a place where they
saw a priest feeding cattle. This priest had such a long beard that it
spread over the ground, and the cattle, instead of eating grass, fed on
the priest&rsquo;s beard, and he could not prevent it. The man called
out: &lsquo;Priest, what is the meaning of this? why is thy beard
pasture for these cattle?&rsquo; The priest replied: &lsquo;I have seen
many pass by like thee, but none has returned. When thou comest back I
shall answer thy question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>They journeyed on again until they came to a place where they saw
nothing but boiling pitch, and a flame came forth from it&mdash;and
this was hell. The ram said: &lsquo;Sit firmly on my back, for we must
pass through this fire.&rsquo; The man held fast, the ram gave a leap,
and they escaped through the fire unhurt.</p>
<p>There they saw a melancholy woman seated on a golden throne. She
said: &lsquo;What is it, my child? what troubles thee? what has brought
thee here?&rsquo; He told her everything that had happened to him. She
said: &lsquo;I must punish this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21"
href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>very wicked child of mine, and
thou must take him a casket from me.&rsquo; She gave him a casket, and
said: &lsquo;Whatever thou dost, do not open this casket thyself, take
it with thee, give it to thy lord, and run quickly away from
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The man took the casket and went away. He came to the place where
the priest was feeding the cattle. The priest said: &lsquo;I promised
thee an answer; hearken unto my words. In life I loved nothing but
myself, I cared for nought else. My flocks I fed on other pastures than
my own, and the neighbouring cattle died of starvation; now I am paying
the penalty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then he went on to the place where the man and woman were sitting on
the handle of the axe. They said: &lsquo;We promised thee an answer;
hearken unto our words. We loved each other too well on earth, and it
is the same with us here.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1044src"
href="#xd21e1044" name="xd21e1044src">1</a></p>
<p>Then he came to the two seated on the bullock skin, which was not
big enough for them. They said: &lsquo;We promised thee an answer;
hearken unto our words. We despised each other in life, and we equally
despise each other here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At last the man came up on earth, descended from the ram, and went
to his lord. He gave him the casket and quickly ran away. The lord
opened the casket, and there came forth fire, which swallowed him up.
Our brother was thus victorious over his enemy, and no one took his
wife from him. They lived lovingly together, and blessed God as their
deliverer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=

<h2 class="main">Fate</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a mighty king, who had an only son.
When this son grew up every princess was in love with him. The king was
very desirous that his son should be early settled in life. He chose
for him a princess, whom he proposed he should marry. The son objected
very much, saying: &lsquo;It is not my fate to be united to this
maiden; I shall not marry her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some time after this the youth came to his father and said: &lsquo;I
entreat thee, let me go forth and seek my fortune, and give me three
bags of money.&rsquo; The king granted his request. The prince prepared
everything, and set out on his journey.</p>
<p>He travelled on until he met a stranger; this stranger was an angel,
clad in the form of a man. He inquired of the prince: &lsquo;Whither
art thou going? what seekest thou?&rsquo; The prince told him all, and
that he wished to learn what was written in the book of fate for him.
Then this stranger showed him a beautiful palace, and said:
&lsquo;There thou wilt learn thy fate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prince thanked him, and set out for the palace. When he arrived
in the courtyard, he looked round, and saw notes lying about. He began
to examine them, but, for a long time, he searched in vain. Then there
came from the palace another man, who said to the prince: &lsquo;What
dost thou want, brother? what seekest thou?&rsquo; The prince answered:
&lsquo;I am seeking for the letter in which my fate is written.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Why seekest thou there? those are only <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>poor
folks&rsquo; fates, kings&rsquo; fortunes are written inside. Come with
me and I shall show thee thine,&rsquo; said the unknown.</p>
<p>The prince entered the house. The unknown searched for his fate, and
called him. Inside was written: &lsquo;Such-and-such a prince will
marry a weaver&rsquo;s daughter who has been ill for nine years.&rsquo;
He read this out, and the prince was struck with horror. &lsquo;I shall
change my fate,&rsquo; said the prince to himself. He took his letter
of fate, and went to seek the weaver&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>He went on and on, and was in a thick forest when the shades of
evening fell. He wandered on in the hope of finding shelter, and at
last he saw the glimmer of a light. He came to a hut, and asked
permission to remain there during the night. The master of the house
replied: &lsquo;Son, thou art a great man, we have nothing befitting
thy rank, but we can give thee the best we have, for a guest is a gift
of God.&rsquo; The prince stayed there that night, and his host grudged
him nothing. When they had finished supper, the prince noticed that
somebody was having a meal in another room. He said to his host:
&lsquo;I hope that thou wilt not think me inquisitive if I ask who is
in the other room, and what is the meaning of this?&rsquo; Then the
host told him the following tale:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I am a weaver, and from day to day can barely live. God has
given me nobody to help me in my work. I have an only daughter, and she
is an invalid. For nine years she has not risen from her bed; I can
assure thee she gives me no help.&rsquo; When the prince heard this, he
bit his little finger with vexation, and became melancholy. He did not
close his eyes that night. He was thinking all the time how he might
get rid of his fate.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, when every one was snoring <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>and
slept like the dead, the prince rose silently, stole from his
bedchamber, and quietly entered the room of the weaver&rsquo;s
daughter. When he saw her he was inwardly troubled, he drew forth his
dagger, and plunged it into her. Then he noiselessly went away, left
his money behind him, and stole forth into the night.</p>
<p>He went home to his father, and complained of the evil fate written
for him. His father was very indignant at this, but hid his anger, and
comforted his son.</p>
<p>Some time passed. One day the prince went out to hunt. He saw in a
lonely wood a beautiful palace, and, in the palace, a maiden fair as
the sun. The prince could have gazed for ever on her beauty. He looked
a long time, then looking from a distance would not satisfy him. He
spurred his horse, and when he came near he was even more struck with
the loveliness of the maiden. He descended from his horse, came to her
and asked her to marry him. When he had heard with joy her sweet words
of consent, he went gaily home.</p>
<p>On the way, his head swam with pleasure at the thought of the
welcome change; instead of the unhappy fate promised him, he was to
have such a beautiful wife. He told his father what had happened to
him, and asked him to prepare for the wedding. The king rejoiced at the
happiness of his beloved son, and made preparations for a grand
wedding.</p>
<p>Some days after they were married, the prince laid his hand on his
lovely wife&rsquo;s heart, and felt something hard like a wart. He
said: &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; His wife replied: &lsquo;I am a poor
weaver&rsquo;s daughter; for nine years I lay in bed, a helpless
invalid, yellow as a cucumber. Once there came a youth to my
father&rsquo;s house for shelter. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>plunged his dagger into
me, then fled with haste, and went on his way. I was very sick, but my
mother put a plaster on my side and I was completely cured. The guest
left three bags of money behind him, and with these we bought a
beautiful palace, my father gave up weaving, and we lived without a
care.&rsquo; When the prince heard this, he said: &lsquo;O God! Thy
decrees are not vain and futile!&rsquo; Then he told his beloved wife
all that had happened to him.</p>

<h2 class="main">Ghvthisavari (I am of God)</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a king, who had a daughter so
beautiful, that he was in constant fear lest some one should carry her
away by force and marry her. So he had a huge tower built in the sea.
He shut his daughter up in this tower, with an attendant, and felt
relieved.</p>
<p>Some time passed, when one day the attendant noticed something
floating on the water. She was surprised when she saw that it was a
large apple. She stretched out her dress, and the sea waves rolled in
and left the apple in her skirt; she took it in her hand, and ran to
her mistress. The beautiful maiden had never in her life seen such a
big apple, and was very much astonished. After dinner she peeled it,
gave the skin to her companion, who quickly finished it, and ate the
inside herself.</p>
<p>In a short time they both became pregnant. The king was informed of
this. On hearing the news, he pressed his head between his hands, and
could not contain his wrath. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href=
"#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>He commanded one of his huntsmen,
saying: &lsquo;Go to the tower in the sea, take thence my daughter and
her companion, and carry them to the wildest and most desert spot in my
kingdom. Kill them, and bring me their hearts and livers to show me
that they are dead. No one must know this story, save thee and me; if
it becomes known it shall cost thee thy life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The huntsman went to the tower, and declared the king&rsquo;s orders
to the princess and her companion. The beautiful maiden said:
&lsquo;What will it avail thee to kill us? Take us to a lonely place,
and no one will know whether we are dead or alive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The huntsman was not moved by these entreaties; he took them to a
desert place, drew his dagger and was about to strike the fatal blow,
but at the last moment he felt sorry for them, and gave up his
intention. He caught two hares, killed them instead of the women, took
out their hearts and livers, and returned with them to the king. The
king believed them to be the hearts and livers of the princess and her
attendant; he gave the huntsman gifts, and sent him away.</p>
<p>The princess and her companion were left alone in the wild wood, and
they had nothing to eat and drink.</p>
<p>In a short time the princess brought forth a beautiful boy, and the
attendant, eight tiny little dogs. The princess called her son
Ghvthisavari (I am of God). He grew as much in a day as other children
grow in a year; he became so handsome, brave, and strong, that
everybody loved him.</p>
<p>Ghvthisavari used to go out hunting; he took his dogs with him, and
provided game for his mother and her companion.</p>
<p>Once he went into a town to a smith, and asked him to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>make a
bow and arrows. The smith made from nine <i>litras</i> of iron (a
<i>litra</i> = 9 lbs.) a bow and arrows. Ghvthisavari bent it. Then the
smith added more iron, and made the bow again. Ghvthisavari slung his
arrows over his shoulders, his dogs followed him, and he went away. On
the way he hunted, and took food home to his mother.</p>
<p>The next day he went to hunt again. He shot an arrow and killed a
goat, he shot another, and killed a stag; he drew his bow a third time,
and his arrow stuck in a <i>devis&rsquo;</i> house. In this house there
were five brothers, <i>devis</i>&mdash;one two-headed, one
three-headed, one five-headed, one nine-headed, and one
ten-headed&mdash;and their mother, who had only one head. They saw an
arrow suddenly fall down and stick in the fire. They all jumped up and
pulled the arrow to draw it out, but they were not able to move it. The
mother helped them, but it was of no use. Then all the brothers rose
up, they left their mother to watch, and set out to seek him who had
shot the arrow. Ghvthisavari bethought himself, and set out; he
followed the flight of the arrow to see where it had fallen.</p>
<p>He went on and on until he came to the <i>devis&rsquo;</i> house. He
looked in and saw in the middle a fire burning, in which stuck his
arrow. He went in, and was about to draw the arrow out when the
<i>devis&rsquo;</i> mother cried: &lsquo;Who art thou, wretch, who
darest to venture here? Art thou not afraid that I shall eat
thee?&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou shalt not eat me,&rsquo; said Ghvthisavari,
drawing out his arrow and hurling it at the old woman. He cut her into
a hundred pieces, gave her to the dogs, and told them to throw her into
the sea. He lay down in the <i>devis&rsquo;</i> house and rested.</p>
<p>The <i>devis</i> wandered far and wide in their search, but nowhere
could they learn any tidings of him they sought. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>Then
they said: &lsquo;Perhaps some one will enter our house and steal,
while we are here. Let one of us go home, and the rest watch
here.&rsquo; Each wished to go, and promised to run back again as
quickly as possible. But the <i>devis</i> chose the two-headed brother,
and sent him.</p>
<p>The two-headed brother came, and saw that his mother was no longer
there, but in her place was a strange youth. He clapped him on the
shoulder, and cried out: &lsquo;Who art thou, wretch, who darest to
venture here? For fear of me, bird cannot fly under heaven, nor can ant
crawl on earth. Art thou not afraid that I shall eat thee?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thou shalt not eat me,&rsquo; said Ghvthisavari, throwing an
arrow. He cut him into a hundred pieces, gave him to the dogs, and made
them throw him into the sea.</p>
<p>The four remaining <i>devis</i> waited for their two-headed brother,
but he did not come. They thought that perhaps he was staying eating
him who had shot the arrow, so they sent the three-headed brother.</p>
<p>The three-headed <i>devi</i> came home, and found neither his mother
nor brother, and called out: &lsquo;For fear of me bird cannot fly in
air, nor can ant creep on earth. Who art thou who darest to venture
here? Art thou not afraid that I shall eat thee?&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou
<span class="corr" id="xd21e1166" title="Source: thalt">shalt</span>
not eat me,&rsquo; said Ghvthisavari, casting an arrow. He cut him into
a hundred pieces, gave him to the dogs, and made them throw him into
the sea.</p>
<p>The remaining brothers waited and waited, and then sent the
five-headed <i>devi</i>. He too boasted, but Ghvthisavari did unto him
that day even as he had done unto the others. Then the nine-headed
<i>devi</i> went. The same thing befell him as his brothers.</p>
<p>The ten-headed <i>devi</i> was now the only one left. He
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>thought to himself: &lsquo;My brothers are
probably eating, and will not leave anything for me.&rsquo; He rose and
went too.</p>
<p>He went in and saw that his mother and brothers were not there.
Instead, there was a strange youth, lying down resting. The <i>devi</i>
called out: &lsquo;From fear of me the bird in heaven dare not fly, on
earth the ant dare not crawl. Who art thou who darest to venture here?
Art thou not afraid that I shall eat thee?&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou shalt not
eat me,&rsquo; said Ghvthisavari, throwing an arrow and killing him. He
drew out his sword, cut off his heads, and gave him to the dogs to
throw into the sea.</p>
<p>Ghvthisavari was left master of the field. Then he said to himself:
&lsquo;I will go and bring my mother and her companion here, and I
shall live as I like.&rsquo; He went forth and brought them, settled
them in the house, and prepared for the chase.</p>
<p>From the sea there staggered forth the last ten-headed <i>devi</i>,
and hid under a tree. When Ghvthisavari had cut off his heads, in his
haste he had left the tenth on. Now, it was in this head that the soul
was placed, so the <i>devi</i> came out on to the shore, full of
wrath.</p>
<p>The next day Ghvthisavari again went out hunting. His mother,
wishing to see the surroundings, went out of the house into the garden.
As she walked about, the <i>devi</i> suddenly appeared at the foot of a
tree. The <i>devi</i> pleaded, saying: &lsquo;Do not give me up! Do not
tell thy son that I am hidden here!&rsquo; Ghvthisavari&rsquo;s mother
promised, and when Ghvthisavari went out to the chase, his mother
always took food and drink to the <i>devi</i>. And at last she loved
him.</p>
<p>Once the <i>devi</i> said to her: &lsquo;Why should we live thus?
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>We see each other only in secret, I am continually
in terror of thy son. Go home now, lie down in bed and pretend to be
ill. When thy son comes home and asks thee what is the matter, say to
him: &ldquo;Go to such and such a place and bring me some pieces of
stag&rsquo;s horns as a remedy.&rdquo; When thy son goes to the stag,
it will butt him with its horns, and then thou and I shall remain here
alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman agreed to this plan, went in and lay down in her bed.
Ghvthisavari came home, and seeing his mother sick, he said to her:
&lsquo;What is the matter? Tell me what will cure thee, and I will find
it, even if it be bird&rsquo;s milk.&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1220src" href="#xd21e1220" name="xd21e1220src">1</a> His mother
said: &lsquo;If thou canst bring to me a piece of such and such a
stag&rsquo;s horn, from a certain place, I shall be well; if not, I
shall die.&rsquo; Ghvthisavari slung his bow and arrows over his
shoulders, took his dogs and set out.</p>
<p>When he had gone some way, he came to an immense wide plain, where
he saw a stag feeding. It had such large horns that they reached to
heaven.</p>
<p>He sat down and took an arrow. Just as he was about to let it fly,
the stag made a sign, and cried out: &lsquo;Ghvthisavari! Ghvthisavari!
why shoot me? What have I done to deserve this of thee? Dost thou not
know that thy mother has deceived thee. She seeks thy ruin, therefore
has she sent thee hither. Behold, here is a piece of my horn, take it,
and here is one of my hairs, take it with thee also, and when thou art
in trouble, think of me, and I shall be there.&rsquo; Ghvthisavari
thanked the stag joyfully, and went away.</p>
<p>He went home with the stag&rsquo;s horn to his mother. She took it,
and thanked him.</p>
<p>The next day Ghvthisavari again went to the chase. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>His
mother immediately hastened to the <i>devi</i> and said:
&lsquo;Ghvthisavari has returned unharmed, and has brought the
stag&rsquo;s horn.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the <i>devi</i>,
&lsquo;pretend to be ill as before, and tell him that he must bring a
wild boar&rsquo;s bristle from such and such a place, else there is no
cure for thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman ran in, lay down in bed, and began to moan. Ghvthisavari
returned, and seeing his mother ill, he asked her: &lsquo;What is this,
mother? What aileth thee? Tell me what will cure thee, and even
bird&rsquo;s milk I will not leave unfound.&rsquo; &lsquo;If thou wilt
seek in such and such a place, and bring me a bristle from a certain
wild boar, then all will be well, but if not, I shall die.&rsquo;
&lsquo;May thy Ghvthisavari die if he find not this!&rsquo; said
Ghvthisavari, slinging his bow and arrows on his shoulders, and taking
his dogs, he set forth on the quest.</p>
<p>He went a long way, and came into a wood. There he found a
boar&rsquo;s lair, but boar was there none. He went on a little, and
saw another lair, but again there was no boar in it. He went away once
more, and saw the boar itself. It had changed its lair twice, and now
lay in a third. Ghvthisavari approached it, took aim with an arrow,
but, as he was about to let it fly, the boar cried out:
&lsquo;Ghvthisavari! Ghvthisavari! what have I done to harm thee? Why
kill me? Dost thou not know that thy mother has deceived thee? She
wishes for thy death, therefore has she sent thee hither. But since
thou wouldst like a bristle, pull out as many as thou wishest, and take
them with thee.&rsquo; Ghvthisavari came up, took a bristle, and was
going away, when the boar took out a hair, gave it to him, and said:
&lsquo;Here is also a hair for thee; when thou art in trouble remember
me, and I shall come to thee.&rsquo; Ghvthisavari took the hair,
thanked the boar, and went away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32"
href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>He came home, gave his mother the bristle, and again hastened out to
the chase. His mother ran immediately to the <i>devi</i>, and said
complainingly: &lsquo;Ghvthisavari has returned unharmed, and has
brought me the boar&rsquo;s bristle.&rsquo; The <i>devi</i> replied:
&lsquo;Then go, again, pretend to be ill, and say to Ghvthisavari:
&ldquo;If thou wilt go to a certain place, where a certain griffin
(<i lang="ka-latn">phascundzi</i>) lives, and bring me the flesh of its
young, I shall be well; if not, I shall die.&rdquo; Thou knowest he
cannot do that, and thou and I shall stay here together.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman rejoiced, ran quickly back to bed, and began to moan.
Ghvthisavari came in, saw his mother in bed, and asked the cause. His
mother replied as the <i>devi</i> had commanded. Ghvthisavari answered:
&lsquo;Then may Ghvthisavari die if he find not what thou
wishest.&rsquo; He went away.</p>
<p>He went on and on, and at last came to a plain, where stood a very
big tree, whose top stretched to heaven. On a branch there was a nest,
from which fledglings peeped out. Then, from far away in the sky, there
appeared a huge, strange bird, something like an eagle. It swooped
down, and just as it was about to seize the young birds, Ghvthisavari
drew his bow, and killed it. Just then appeared the griffin, mother of
the young ones. She thought Ghvthisavari her enemy, and was about to
seize him, but her fledglings cried out that he had killed the bird
that would have drunk their blood, and had saved them.</p>
<p>Although the griffin did not bring up more than three birds in a
year, yet she was in constant terror until they had learnt to fly,
because this same bird used to seize and eat them.</p>
<p>When she learnt that Ghvthisavari had killed their cruel enemy, she
came to him, and said: &lsquo;Tell me what thou <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>wishest?
why art thou come hither? and I will immediately satisfy thy
desire.&rsquo; Ghvthisavari said: &lsquo;I have a mother who is ill;
unless I take her young griffin&rsquo;s flesh she will die.&rsquo; The
griffin said in reply: &lsquo;Thy mother deceives thee, and is not ill
at all; she seeks thy death. Here are my fledglings, if thou wantest
them, but do not kill them, take them with thee alive.&rsquo; She
pulled out a feather, and gave it to him, saying: &lsquo;Take this with
thee, and when thou art in trouble think of me, and I shall be
there.&rsquo; Ghvthisavari thanked her heartily, took away a fledgling,
and went home.</p>
<p>He came in, gave the young griffin to his mother, who said:
&lsquo;Now, my child, I am quite well, and shall want nothing
else,&rsquo; and she sent him away. Ghvthisavari went out hunting. The
woman went out hastily to the <i>devi</i>, and complained, saying:
&lsquo;Ghvthisavari has brought the fledgling, and he himself has
returned alive.&rsquo; The <i>devi</i> was very angry, but calmed down
and said: &lsquo;When Ghvthisavari comes in, tell him he must be
bathed, and when he sits down in the tub, put a cover over him and call
for me. I will come and hammer down the lid, and throw him into the
sea.&rsquo; The woman rejoiced at this plan, went in and heated water.
When Ghvthisavari came in, his mother said: &lsquo;Come, child, I will
bathe thee, it is some time since thou wert bathed.&rsquo; Ghvthisavari
did not like this, but at last he consented. He sat down in the tub,
his mother shut the lid, and called the <i>devi</i>. The <i>devi</i>
ran in and hammered down the lid. Then he lifted the tub up and rolled
it into the sea.</p>
<p>Ghvthisavari&rsquo;s dogs saw this; they went to the edge of the
water and barked. They barked until the very stones might have been
moved with pity. Then they said: &lsquo;Let <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>us go
and seek his friends, they may perchance help us.&rsquo; Four remained
and four went to seek his friends. They came to the stag, then to the
boar, and then to the griffin. These all arose and immediately went to
the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>They thought and planned, and at last decided what to do. They said
to the griffin: &lsquo;Fly up high, strike and cleave the water with
thy wings, the tub will appear, the stag will throw it on to the shore
with its horns; then the boar will strike with his tusk, the tub will
break, and Ghvthisavari will come forth.&rsquo; They all did as they
were told.</p>
<p>The griffin flew up high in the air, beat with its wings as hard as
it could; it cleft the sea into three. The tub was seen, and the stag
did not let it fall, but threw it with its horns, and let it down on
the shore. Then the boar struck it, crying out: &lsquo;Ghvthisavari,
lie down in the bottom!&rsquo; He struck with his tusk, broke the tub,
and Ghvthisavari came forth unharmed.</p>
<p>After this the friends went away, each to his own home, Ghvthisavari
remained thinking. Just then a ragged swineherd came along.
Ghvthisavari said to this swineherd: &lsquo;Come, give me thy clothes,
and I will put them on.&rsquo; The swineherd was afraid, and thought:
&lsquo;This stranger will take my coat and not give me his,&rsquo; and
he ran away. Ghvthisavari pursued him, took off his clothes, and put
them on himself; he gave the man his coat, left with him his dogs, and
went away.</p>
<p>He came home as if he were a beggar, and asked alms of his mother.
When the <i>devi</i> saw him, he looked ferociously at him, and said:
&lsquo;Go back to the place whence thou camest, lest I do to thee as
thou deservest.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Just then Ghvthisavari saw his bow and arrow in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>corner,
and cried out: &lsquo;We shall see who goes hence! I am
Ghvthisavari!&rsquo; Saying this he drew his bow, shot first the
<i>devi</i> and then his mother, killing them both. Then he went to the
companion, scolded her well for not warning him, and killed her too. He
went away, brought his dogs, and returned to the house to rest.</p>
<p>There came then, no one knows whence, a certain youth; he saw his
father, mother, and their servant were all killed, and asked
Ghvthisavari to fight. He was Ghvthisavari&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s son
by the <i>devi</i>; Ghvthisavari did not know this, and came to the
combat. A long time they struggled, a long time they strove, but
neither could strike the other. Then Ghvthisavari said: &lsquo;Come,
friend, let us each tell the other his story, and afterwards we can
fight.&rsquo; &lsquo;Good!&rsquo; &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; they said,
and each told his tale.</p>
<p>When Ghvthisavari learnt that this was his own brother, he said:
&lsquo;It is indeed fortunate that we told our tales first, for if we
had killed each other there would have been no help for it.&rsquo;
After this the two brothers went into the house, and they lived happily
together.</p>
<p>Once Ghvthisavari said to his younger brother: &lsquo;Let us go,
brother, and seek our fortunes, we shall become like old women if we
live thus.&rsquo; &lsquo;I am willing,&rsquo; replied the younger; so
they set out.</p>
<p>They wandered on until they came to a place where two roads met. One
led to the right and one to the left. In the middle of the roads stood
a stone pillar, on which was written: &lsquo;Whoever goes to the left
will come back, but he who goes to the right will never return.&rsquo;
Ghvthisavari took the road to the right and his brother went to the
left. Ghvthisavari said: &lsquo;Know that if the water on the roof
changes into blood I shall be in trouble. Come then to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>my aid.
If the water on my roof turns into blood, I shall come and help thee in
thy trouble.&rsquo; Then they divided the dogs: each took four, said
farewell, and set out.</p>
<p>Ghvthisavari went on until he came to the shore of a sea, so vast
that the eye could not measure it. Twelve men were on this side, twelve
on that. Whoever comes to this sea must jump over; if he leaps over
without wetting his feet he may marry the king&rsquo;s daughter, who is
very beautiful; if not, he is drowned in the sea; and whoever dares not
jump at all is seized by the sentinels, and taken before the king.</p>
<p>Ghvthisavari came, and the sentinels told him the conditions.
Ghvthisavari took a spring with all his might and main, and leaped over
so that not a drop of water touched him. He saw the other sentinels,
and they told him that they must take him before the king. When the
king saw him he rejoiced, and gave him his fair daughter to wife.</p>
<p>That night Ghvthisavari asked his wife: &lsquo;Where is the best
hunting to be had in the kingdom?&rsquo; She replied: &lsquo;If thou
goest to the left thou wilt return; if thou goest to the right thou
wilt never return.&rsquo; The next morning Ghvthisavari arose at
daybreak, took his bow and arrow, and went to the right hand.</p>
<p>He shot an arrow and killed a hare, he tied its feet and left it; he
shot another arrow and killed a stag, he bound its feet together and
left it too. He shot a third arrow, and it stuck in a burning fire.</p>
<p>He went on and on until he reached this fire. Then he killed a stag,
put it on the fire, and sat down at the side. He roasted meat, ate
some, and gave some to his dogs. Behold, no one knows whence, a
toothless old woman appeared. She begged Ghvthisavari to give her
something <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>to eat. He did so; he ate, but the old woman ate
ten times more. For every mouthful Ghvthisavari took she took a
basketful. Ghvthisavari looked on in amazement. The old woman finished
all the food. Then she took a little stone and threw it at
Ghvthisavari&rsquo;s bow and arrow. They turned into stone, and fell on
the ground. Then she took the little stone and threw it at the dogs,
who also became petrified. She took them one by one in her hand and
swallowed them. Ghvthisavari was stupefied; he seized his bow and arrow
to kill the old woman, but he could not move it; it fell to earth. Then
the old woman turned her stone towards Ghvthisavari, who lost his
strength, and became as a corpse. The old woman lifted him up in her
hand and swallowed him. At that moment the water changed to blood, and
the younger brother knew that Ghvthisavari had fallen into misfortune,
and set out to help him.</p>
<p>When he had gone some way he came to the water&rsquo;s edge, on each
side of which stood the twelve sentinels. He leaped across. The
sentinels were surprised, they thought it was Ghvthisavari, and asked
him whence he came and whither he was going. The youth told them
nothing, and did not let them know who he was. He came to the king.
That night he was given his brother&rsquo;s wife, but when he lay down
he put a sword between them, and did not touch her. Then he asked her:
&lsquo;Where is the best hunting?&rsquo; She replied: &lsquo;If thou
goest to the left thou wilt return, if to the right thou wilt never
return. Do not go; did I not tell thee the same thing yesterday?&rsquo;
&lsquo;I asked thee, and I went one way, but did not like it; now I ask
thee again,&rsquo; said the youth. He rose the next morning, and went
to the right hand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38"
name="pb38">38</a>]</span></p>
<p>When he had gone a little way he saw the dead hare with its feet
bound; he went on farther and saw the dead stag with its feet bound. He
said to himself: &lsquo;My brother must have come this way; this is
some of the game he has killed.&rsquo; He again went on, and saw the
fire burning. Beside it lay Ghvthisavari&rsquo;s bow and arrow, and he
said to himself: &lsquo;Here my brother has met his fate.&rsquo; Then
he killed some game and roasted it on the fire.</p>
<p>There appeared, no one knows whence, the same old woman. She sat
down and waited for her share of roast meat. In eating, the old
woman&rsquo;s behaviour was the same as before. When she had finished
the food she was still hungry. She took a little stone, and lifted it
to throw at the dogs. The youth thought to himself: &lsquo;It must have
been in this way that this old woman swallowed my brother
Ghvthisavari.&rsquo; He seized the old woman by the throat, cleft her
breast open, and took out Ghvthisavari and his dogs. Then he killed the
old woman and poured her blood over Ghvthisavari, the dogs, and the bow
and arrow. Ghvthisavari and his dogs came back to life, and the bow and
arrow were raised from the earth. When Ghvthisavari woke to
consciousness he said: &lsquo;Ugh! I have had such a dream.&rsquo; Then
his brother said: &lsquo;Thou hast not dreamt&rsquo;; and he told him
what had happened.</p>
<p>Ghvthisavari rejoiced, and they both went to their new kinsman, the
king. On the way, Ghvthisavari was very melancholy, for he thought that
his brother must have married his wife. His brother looked at him and
said: &lsquo;May this arrow strike me on the part of my body that has
touched thy wife, and kill me.&rsquo; Thus spoke Ghvthisavari&rsquo;s
brother, and threw up an arrow. It fell, struck him in the little
finger, and he died. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39"
name="pb39">39</a>]</span>Ghvthisavari left his brother, went in, and,
when he had learnt all, was deeply grieved. He went, no one knows
where, found immortal water, and brought his brother back to life. Then
he found him a fair wife, and they dwelt together, happy in fraternal
affection and in love.</p>

<h2 class="label">VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Serpent and the Peasant</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a happy king. Great or small, maid or
man, every one was happy in his kingdom, every one was joyful and
glad.</p>
<p>Once this monarch saw a vision. In his dream there hung from the
ceiling in his house a fox suspended by the tail. He awoke, he could
not see what the dream signified. He assembled his viziers, but they
also could not divine what this dream presaged.</p>
<p>Then he said: &lsquo;Assemble all my kingdom together, perhaps some
one may interpret it.&rsquo; On the third day all the people of his
kingdom assembled in the king&rsquo;s palace. Among others came a poor
peasant.</p>
<p>In one place he had to travel along a footpath. The path on both
sides was shut in by rocky mountains. When the peasant arrived there,
he saw a serpent lying on the path, stretching its neck and putting out
its tongue.</p>
<p>When the peasant went near, the serpent called out: &lsquo;Good day,
where art thou going, peasant?&rsquo; The peasant told what was the
matter. The serpent said: &lsquo;Do not fear him, give me thy word that
what the king gives, thou wilt share with me, and I will teach
thee.&rsquo; The peasant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href=
"#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>rejoiced, gave his word, and swore,
saying: &lsquo;I will bring thee all that the king presents to me if
thou wilt aid me in this matter.&rsquo; The serpent said: &lsquo;I
shall divide it in halves, half will be thine; when thou seest the
king, say: &ldquo;The fox meant this, that in the kingdom there is
cunning, hypocrisy, and treachery.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>The peasant went, he approached the king, and told even what the
serpent had taught. The king was very much pleased, and gave great
presents. The peasant did not return by that way, so that he might not
share with the serpent, but went by another path.</p>
<p>Some time passed by, the king saw another vision: in his dream a
naked sword hung suspended from the roof. The king this time sent a man
quickly for the peasant, and asked him to come. The peasant was very
uneasy in mind. There was nothing for it, the peasant went by the same
footpath as before.</p>
<p>He came to that place where he saw the serpent before, but now he
saw the serpent there no more. He cried out: &lsquo;O serpent, come
here one moment, I need thee.&rsquo; He ceased not until the serpent
came. It said: &lsquo;What dost thou want? what distresses thee?&rsquo;
The peasant answered: &lsquo;Thus and thus is the matter, and I should
like some aid.&rsquo; The serpent replied: &lsquo;Go, tell the king
that the naked sword means war&mdash;now enemies are intriguing within
and without; he must prepare for battle and attack.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The peasant thanked the serpent and went. He came and told the king
even as the serpent had commanded. The king was pleased, he began to
prepare for war, and gave the peasant great presents. Now the peasant
went by that path where the serpent was waiting. The serpent said:
&lsquo;Now give me the half thou hast promised.&rsquo; The peasant
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>replied: &lsquo;Half, certainly not! I shall give
thee a black stone and a burning cinder.&rsquo; He drew out his sword
and pursued it. The serpent retreated into a hole, but the peasant
followed it, and cut off its tail with his sword.</p>
<p>Some time passed, and the king again saw a vision. In this vision a
slain sheep was hanging from the roof. The king sent a man quickly for
the peasant. The peasant was now very much afraid. And he said:
&lsquo;How can I approach the king?&rsquo; Formerly the serpent had
taught him, but now it could no longer do this; for its goodness he had
wounded it with the sword.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he went by that footpath. When he came to the place
where the serpent had been, he cried out: &lsquo;O serpent, come here
one moment, I want to ask thee something.&rsquo; The serpent came. The
man told his grief. The serpent said: &lsquo;If thou givest me half of
what the king gives thee, I shall tell thee.&rsquo; He promised and
swore. The serpent said: &lsquo;This is a sign that now everywhere
peace falls on all, the people are become like quiet, gentle
sheep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The peasant thanked it, and went his way. When he came to the king,
he spoke as the serpent had instructed him. The king was exceedingly
pleased, and gave him greater presents. The peasant returned by the way
where the serpent was waiting. He came to the serpent, divided
everything he had received from the king, and said: &lsquo;Thou hast
been patient with me, and now I will give thee even what was given me
before by the king.&rsquo; He humbly asked forgiveness for his former
offences. The serpent said: &lsquo;Be not grieved nor troubled; it
certainly was not thy fault. The first time, when all the people were
entirely deceitful, and there was treachery and hypocrisy in the land,
thou <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>too wert a deceiver, for, in spite of thy promise,
thou wentest home by another way. The second time, when there was war
everywhere, quarrels and assassination, thou, too, didst quarrel with
me, and cut off my tail. But now, when peace and love have fallen on
all, thou bringest the gifts, and sharest all with me. Go, brother, may
the peace of God rest with thee! I do not want thy wealth.&rsquo; And
the serpent went away and cast itself into its hole.</p>

<h2 class="label">VIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">Gulambara and Sulambara</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was and there was not at all, there was a blind
monarch; all the doctors in the kingdom had been applied to, but the
king could not be cured.</p>
<p>At last one doctor said: &lsquo;In a certain sea is a fish red as
blood. If this is caught, killed, and its blood sprinkled on your eyes,
it may do good&mdash;the light will come back into your eyes&mdash;if
not, there can be no other cure for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the king assembled every fisherman in his realm, and commanded:
&lsquo;Go wherever it may be or may not be, catch such a fish as this,
and I shall give you a rich reward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some time passed by. An old fisherman caught just such a crimson
fish, and took it to the king. The king was asleep, and they did not
dare to wake him, so they put the fish into a basin full of water.</p>
<p>Just then his son returned from his lessons. He saw the blood-red
fish swimming in the basin. He took it up in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>his
hands, caressed it, and said: &lsquo;What do you want with the pretty
fish in the basin?&rsquo; They said to him: &lsquo;This is good for
your father, it must be killed, its blood sprinkled on his eyes, and he
will regain his sight.&rsquo; &lsquo;But is it not a sin to kill
it?&rsquo; asked the prince; and he took the fish out to a stream in
the meadow, and gave it freedom.</p>
<p>A little while after, the king awoke; his viziers said to him:
&lsquo;An old fisherman brought to you a blood-red fish, but your son,
who had just returned from his lessons, let it away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The king was very angry, and sent his son from the house. &lsquo;Go
hence, I shall be well when thou art no longer remembered in the
kingdom; with my eyes I cannot look upon thee, but never let me hear
thine unpleasant voice again.&rsquo; The boy was grieved, rose, and
went away.</p>
<p>He went, he went, and he knew not whither he went. On the way he saw
a stream. He was weary and sat down to rest on the bank. Behold, a boy
of his own age came out of the water. He came to the prince, greeted
him, and said: &lsquo;Whence comest thou? and what troubles
thee?&rsquo; The prince went to him and told him all that had happened
to him. His new acquaintance said: &lsquo;I also am discontented with
my lot, so let us become brothers, and live together.&rsquo; The prince
agreed, and they went on their way.</p>
<p>They travelled on some distance, when they came to a town, and they
dwelt there. When the next day dawned, his adopted brother said to the
prince: &lsquo;Stay thou at home, do not go out of doors, lest they eat
thee, for such is the custom here.&rsquo; The prince promised, and from
morning until night he sat indoors. The other boy was away in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>town all day. At twilight, when he came home, he
had a handkerchief quite full of provisions.</p>
<p>Several days slipped by. The prince stayed in all day, and his
brother brought the food and drink. At last the prince said to himself:
&lsquo;This is shameful! My adopted brother goes out and brings in food
and drink. Why do I not do something? What an idle fellow I am! I will
go and do something!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so it happened that one day the king&rsquo;s son went into the
town; he wandered here and there, and in one place saw his brother, who
was sitting cross-legged on the ground, at his feet was stretched a
pocket handkerchief, in his hand he held a <i lang=
"ka-latn">chonguri</i> (a stringed instrument), which he played, and he
chanted to it with a sweet voice. Whoever passed by placed money in the
handkerchief.</p>
<p>The king&rsquo;s son listened and listened, and said: &lsquo;No,
this must not be; this is not my business.&rsquo; So he turned and went
back.</p>
<p>Near there he saw a tower. Outside was a wall, and on the top were
arranged in rows men&rsquo;s heads: some were quite shrivelled up, some
had an unpleasant odour of decay, and some had just been placed
there.</p>
<p>He looked and looked, and could not understand what it meant. He
asked a man: &lsquo;Whose tower is this, and why are men&rsquo;s heads
arranged in rows in this way?&rsquo; He was told: &lsquo;In this tower
dwells a maiden beautiful as the sun. Any king&rsquo;s son may ask her
in marriage. She asks him a question: if he cannot answer it his head
is cut off, but if he can he may demand her in marriage. No one has yet
been able to answer her question.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prince thought and thought, and said to himself: &lsquo;I will
go. I will ask this maiden in marriage: I will know if <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>this is
my fate. What is to be will be. What can she ask me that I shall not
know?&rsquo; So he rose and went.</p>
<p>He came to the sunlike maiden and asked her in marriage. She
answered: &lsquo;It is well, but first I have a question to ask thee;
if thou canst answer, then I am thine, if not, I shall cut off thy
head.&rsquo; &lsquo;So let it be,&rsquo; said the prince. &lsquo;I ask
thee this, Who are Gulambara and Sulambara?&rsquo; enquired the
beautiful maiden. The king&rsquo;s son said to himself: &lsquo;I know
indeed that Gulambara and Sulambara are names of flowers, but I never
heard in all my life of human beings thus named.&rsquo; He asked three
days grace and went away.</p>
<p>He went home and told his brother what had happened, and said:
&lsquo;If thou canst not help me now, in three days I shall lose my
head.&rsquo; His brother reproached him, saying: &lsquo;Did I not tell
thee to stay indoors? This is a wicked town.&rsquo; But then he
comforted him, saying: &lsquo;Go now, buy a pennyworth of aromatic gum
and a candle. I have a grandmother, I shall take thee to her, and she
will help thee. But at the moment when my grandmother looks at us, give
her the gum and the candle, or she will eat thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He bought the gum and the candle, and they set out. The grandmother
was standing in her doorway; the prince immediately gave her the gum
and the candle. &lsquo;What is it? what is the matter with thee?&rsquo;
enquired the grandmother of the prince&rsquo;s adopted brother. He came
forward, and told everything in detail. Then he added: &lsquo;This is
my good brother, and certainly thou shouldst help him.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the old woman to the prince; &lsquo;sit
down on my back.&rsquo; The prince seated himself on her back. The old
woman flew up high, and then, in the twinkling of an eye, she flew down
into the depths. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span></p>
<p>She took him into a town there, and went to the entrance of a
bazaar. She pointed out a shopkeeper and said: &lsquo;Go and engage
thyself as assistant to this shopkeeper; but in the evening, when he
leaves business and goes home, tell him that he must take thee with
him, and must not leave thee in the shop. Where thou goest with him
thou wilt learn the story of Gulambara and Sulambara. Then when thou
hast need of me, whistle and I shall be there.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prince did exactly as the old woman had instructed him; he went
to the butcher, as his assistant. At twilight, when the butcher spoke
of going home, the prince said to him: &lsquo;Do not leave me here; I
am a stranger in this land. I am afraid; take me with thee.&rsquo; The
butcher objected strongly, but the prince entreated him until he
agreed.</p>
<p>The butcher went home, and took the prince with him. They came to a
wall, opened a door, went in, and it closed. Inside that, was another
wall; they went through that, and it closed. They passed thus through
nine walls, and then they entered a house. The butcher opened a
cupboard door, took out a woman&rsquo;s head, and then an iron whip. He
put down the decaying head and struck it. He struck and struck until
the head was completely gone.</p>
<p>When the prince saw this he was astonished, and enquired:
&lsquo;Tell me, why do you strike this head that is so mutilated, and
whose head is this?&rsquo; The butcher made answer: &lsquo;I tell this
to no one, this is my secret, but if I do tell any one he must then
lose his head.&rsquo; &lsquo;I still wish to know,&rsquo; said the
prince. The butcher rose, took a sword, prepared himself, and said to
the prince. &lsquo;I had a wife who was so lovely that she excelled the
sun; her name was Gulambara. I kept her under these nine locks, and I
took care of her so that not even the wind of heaven blew <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>on her.
Whatever she asked me I gave her at once. I loved her to distraction,
and trusted her, and she told me that she loved no one in the world but
me. At that time I had an assistant who was called Sulambara, and my
wife loved him and deceived me. Once I found them together, and seized
them. I locked one in one cupboard and the other in another. Whenever I
came home from business I went to the cupboards, and took out first one
and then the other, and beat them as hard as I could. I struck so hard
that Sulambara crumbled away yesterday, and only Gulambara&rsquo;s head
remained, and that has just now crumbled away before thine
eyes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The story ended, he took his sword and said to the prince:
&lsquo;Now I am going to fulfil my threat, so come here and I shall cut
off thy head.&rsquo; The prince entreated him: &lsquo;Give me a little
time. I will go to the door and pray to my God, and then do to me even
as thou wishest.&rsquo; The butcher thought: &lsquo;It can do no harm
to let him go to the door for a short time, for he certainly cannot
open the nine doors; let him pray to his God and have his
wish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The prince went to the gate and whistled. Immediately the old woman
flew down, took him on her back, and flew off. The youth went to the
town where the beautiful maiden dwelt, and told the sunlike one the
story of Gulambara and Sulambara. The maiden was very much surprised;
when she had heard all, she agreed to marry him. They were married; she
collected all her worldly possessions, and set out with the prince for
his father&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>When he came to the brook, his adopted brother appeared before him,
and said: &lsquo;In thy trouble I befriended thee, and now, when thou
art happy, shall this friendship cease? Whatever thou hast obtained has
been by my counsel, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>therefore thou shouldst share it with
me.&rsquo; The prince divided everything in halves, but still his
adopted brother was not pleased. &lsquo;It is all very well to share
this with me, whilst thou hast the beautiful maiden.&rsquo; The prince
arose and gave up his own share of the goods.</p>
<p>His adopted brother would not take it, and spoke thus: &lsquo;If
thou holdest fast to our friendship thou shouldst share with me this
maiden, the most precious of thy possessions!&rsquo; As he said this he
seized the maiden&rsquo;s hand, bound her to a tree, stretched forth
his sword, and, as he was about to strike, a green stream flowed from
the terror-stricken maiden&rsquo;s mouth. Again the youth raised his
sword. The same thing happened. A third time he prepared to strike,
with the same result. Then he came, unbound her from the tree, gave her
to the prince, and said: &lsquo;Although this maiden was beautiful, yet
she was venomous, and, sooner or later, would have killed thee. Now
whatever poison was in her is completely gone, so do not fear her in
the slightest degree.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1452src" href=
"#xd21e1452" name="xd21e1452src">1</a> Go! and God guide thee. As for
these possessions, they are thine; I do not want them. May God give
thee His peace.&rsquo; From his pocket he took out a handkerchief, gave
it to the prince, and said: &lsquo;Take this handkerchief with thee;
when thou reachest home wipe thy father&rsquo;s eyes with it and he
will see. I am the fish that was in the basin, and thou didst set me
free. Know, then, that kindness of heart is never lost.&rsquo; So
saying, the prince&rsquo;s adopted brother disappeared.</p>
<p>The prince remained astonished. Before he had time to express his
gratitude the young man had suddenly disappeared. At last, when he had
recovered himself, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49"
name="pb49">49</a>]</span>took his wife and went to his father. He laid
the handkerchief on the king&rsquo;s eyes, and his sight came back to
him. When he saw his only son and his beautiful daughter-in-law his joy
was so great that his eyes filled with tears. His son sat down and told
him all that had happened since he left him.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Two Brothers</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time there were two brothers. Each of them
possessed ten loaves of bread; and they said: &lsquo;Let us go and seek
our fortune.&rsquo; So they arose and went forth.</p>
<p>When they had gone a little way they were hungry. One brother said
to the other: &lsquo;Come, let us eat thy bread first, then we can eat
mine.&rsquo; And he agreed, and they took of his loaves and did eat,
and they afterwards went on their way.</p>
<p>And they travelled for some time in this manner. At last, when these
ten loaves were finished, the brother who had first spoken said:
&lsquo;Now, my brother, thou canst go thy way and I shall go mine. Thou
hast no loaves left, and I will not let thee eat my bread.&rsquo; So
saying, he left him to continue his journey alone.</p>
<p>He went on and on, and came to a mill in a thick forest. He saw the
miller and said: &lsquo;For the love of God, let me stay here
to-night.&rsquo; The miller answered: &lsquo;Brother, it is a very
terrible thing to be here at night; as thou seest, even I go elsewhere.
Presently wild beasts will assemble in the wood, and probably come
here.&rsquo; &lsquo;Have no fear <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50"
href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>for me; I shall stay here. The
beasts cannot kill me,&rsquo; answered the boy. The miller tried to
persuade him not to endanger his life, but when he found his arguments
were of no avail he rose and went home. The boy crept inside the hopper
of the mill.</p>
<p>There appeared, from no one knows where, a big bear; he was followed
by a wolf, then a jackal; and they all made a great noise in the mill.
They leaped and bounded just as if they were having a dance. He was
terrified, and, trembling from fear, he lay down, quaking all over, in
the hopper. At last the bear said: &lsquo;Come, let each of us tell
something he has seen or heard.&rsquo; &lsquo;We shall tell our tales,
but you must begin,&rsquo; cried his companions. The bear said:
&lsquo;Well, on a hill that I know dwells a mouse. This mouse has a
great heap of money, which it spreads out when the sun shines. If any
one knew of this mouse&rsquo;s hole, and went there on a sunny day,
when the money is spread out, and struck the mouse with a twig, and
killed it, he would become possessed of great wealth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not wonderful!&rsquo; said the wolf. &lsquo;I know a
certain town where there is no water, and every mouthful has to be
carried a great distance, and an enormous price is paid for it! The
inhabitants do not know that in the centre of their town, under a
certain stone, is beautiful, pure water. Now, if any one knew of this,
and would roll away that stone, he would obtain great
wealth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is nothing,&rsquo; said the jackal. &lsquo;I know of a
king who has one only daughter, and she has been an invalid for three
years. Quite a simple remedy would cure her: if she were bathed in a
bath of beech leaves she would be healed. You have no idea what a
fortune any one would get if he only knew this.&rsquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span></p>
<p>When they had spoken thus, day began to dawn. The bear, the wolf,
and the jackal went away into the wood. The boy came out of the hopper,
gave thanks to God, and went to the mouse&rsquo;s hole, of which the
bear had spoken.</p>
<p>He arrived, and saw that the story was true. There was the mouse
with the money spread out. He stole up noiselessly, and, taking twigs
in his hand, he struck the mouse until he had killed it, and then
gathered up the money. Then he went to the waterless town, rolled away
the stone, and behold! streams of water flowed forth. He received a
reward for this, and set out for the kingdom of which the jackal had
spoken. He arrived, and enquired of the king: &lsquo;What wilt thou
give me if I cure thy daughter?&rsquo; The king replied: &lsquo;If thou
canst do this I will give thee my daughter to wife.&rsquo; The youth
prepared the remedy, made the princess bathe in it, and she was cured.
The king rejoiced greatly, gave him the maiden in marriage, and
appointed him heir to the kingdom.</p>
<p>This story reached the ears of the youth&rsquo;s brother. He went on
and on, and it came to pass that he found his brother. He asked him:
&lsquo;How and by what cunning has this happened?&rsquo; The fortunate
youth told him all in detail. &lsquo;I also shall go and stay at that
mill a night or two.&rsquo; His brother used many entreaties to
dissuade him, and when he would not listen, said: &lsquo;Well, go if
thou wilt, but I warn thee again it is very dangerous.&rsquo; However,
he would not be persuaded, and went away. He crept into the hopper, and
was there all night.</p>
<p>From some place or other arrived the former guests&mdash;the bear,
the wolf, and the jackal. The bear said: &lsquo;That day when I told
you my story the mouse was killed, and the money all taken away.&rsquo;
The wolf said: &lsquo;And the stone was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>rolled away in the
waterless town of which I spoke.&rsquo; &lsquo;And the king&rsquo;s
daughter was cured,&rsquo; added the jackal. &lsquo;Then perhaps some
one was listening when we talked here,&rsquo; said the bear.
&lsquo;Perhaps some one is here now,&rsquo; shrieked his companions.
&lsquo;Then let us go and look; certainly no one shall listen
again,&rsquo; said the three; and they looked in all the corners. They
sought and sought everywhere. At last the bear looked into the hopper,
and saw the trembling boy. He dragged him out and tore him to
pieces.</p>

<h2 class="label">X</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Prince</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a king who had great possessions, but
his wife had no children, and he was a prey to grief.</p>
<p>One day when he was very melancholy a courtier came to him and said:
&lsquo;Most mighty monarch! thou hast no son, and thou givest no gifts;
what will thy subjects think of thee? What wilt thou do with this
wealth stored up by thee?&rsquo; The king took these words to heart;
the next day he gave a great feast, and scattered alms lavishly.</p>
<p>From no one knows where there appeared at that time an old woman.
She came to the king and said: &lsquo;What wilt thou give me if I bring
thee a son?&rsquo; The king replied: &lsquo;Whatever thou askest of me,
that will I give thee.&rsquo; The old woman drew forth from her pocket
an apple, which she cut in three and gave to the king, saying,
&lsquo;Let thy wife eat this, and she will have three children; but,
remember, I shall come back in seven years and thou must <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>give me
thy youngest son.&rsquo; The king consented, gave his wife the apple,
and she ate it.</p>
<p>Some time passed, and the queen bore three sons, and the youngest
was the most beautiful of all. The king could not bear to think that he
must give him up. He said to himself: &lsquo;I shall put him behind
nine locks, and when the old woman comes, I shall tell her that my
youngest son is dead, but that she can take the two elder if she
wishes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After seven years the old woman came, and demanded of the king his
youngest son. He did just as he had planned. He locked up his youngest
son behind nine locks, and said to the old woman: &lsquo;My youngest
son is dead, but here are the other two, take them.&rsquo; The old
woman would not believe him. She searched every corner of the palace,
opened the nine locks, and took away the young prince. She went
homeward, and took him with her.</p>
<p>When they had gone a little way, they came to a brook where they
found an old woman washing dirty linen. When she saw the beautiful
prince she called him back, and said sadly to him: &lsquo;Dost thou
know thou art being led into misfortune? Why dost thou go with that
witch? Thou certainly canst not escape alive from her hands!&rsquo;
When the prince heard this, he went to the witch and said: &lsquo;Let
me go and have a word with this old woman. I shall overtake thee in a
minute.&rsquo; The witch let him go.</p>
<p>The prince went back to his own home, filled a cup with water, and
placed it near the fire. Having done this, he said: &lsquo;When that
water changes to blood, I shall be dead, but as long as it is pure I
shall be alive.&rsquo; Then he went away, quickly overtook the witch,
and they went on together.</p>
<p>At last they arrived in a dark ravine; the home of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name="pb54">54</a>]</span>witch
was there in a rocky cave. In the house she had three daughters and two
horses&mdash;one for herself and one for her daughters. The old woman
went in, entrusted the prince to her daughters&rsquo; care, and fell
asleep.</p>
<p>Now this old witch had a habit of sleeping for seven days and
nights, and it was impossible to rouse her.</p>
<p>When her daughters saw the prince they admired him very much, and
said: &lsquo;It is a shame that so handsome a boy should be destroyed!
Come, our mother shall not have him to eat; we must help him to escape
in some way.&rsquo; &lsquo;We will!&rsquo; cried the sisters; and they
thought of a plan of escape.</p>
<p>The eldest sister gave him her comb, and said: &lsquo;When my mother
overtakes thee, throw this behind thee and hasten on; a thick forest
will spring up between thee and my mother, who will have difficulty in
passing through it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The second sister gave him a pair of scissors, and said: &lsquo;When
my mother overtakes thee, throw these scissors behind thee&mdash;jagged
rocks, hard as adamant, will rise between thee and my mother, who will
have difficulty in crossing them, but hasten thou on.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youngest sister gave him a lump of salt, and said: &lsquo;When
my mother overtakes thee, throw this behind thee&mdash;between you will
roll a sea, which my mother will never cross.&rsquo; Then they
carefully saddled their own steed, gave the youth everything he wanted,
and sent him away. He thanked them heartily and set out.</p>
<p>Seven days passed. The witch awoke, and looked for her dinner, but
it was no longer there. She went to her steed and enquired of it,
&lsquo;Shall we eat bread or shall we set out at once?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Whether we eat bread or not we cannot overtake him,&rsquo; said
the steed to the witch. She did <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55"
href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>not abandon her intention, but,
having eaten bread, mounted her horse and set off in pursuit of the
prince.</p>
<p>After riding some distance she overtook him. The prince looked back,
and, seeing the old woman approach, drew the comb from his pocket and
threw it down behind him. Between them, there rose a forest so thick
that even a fly could not go through it. The old woman was annoyed and
hindered, but at last, in some way or other, she passed through it.</p>
<p>When she reached the open country she spurred her horse on with
might and main, and again approached the prince, who looked behind and
saw the old woman. He took the scissors from his pocket, and threw them
down. Between them appeared a jagged rock, hard as steel, so that no
iron could cut it; the horse cut its feet, and, not being able to go
any further, fell down; yet the old woman would not give in. She jumped
from the horse&rsquo;s back and went forward on foot. She passed the
rocks, reached the plain again, and hastened on.</p>
<p>She flew over the ground as if she had wings. The prince looked
back, and saw how near the old woman was. He took the piece of salt
from his pocket, and threw it behind him. There flowed between them a
sea so vast that no bird could cross it. The old woman was not daunted,
even by this, she waded into the sea, determined to cross it, but she
was drowned.</p>
<p>The prince often looked behind, but he could no longer see the old
woman. Then his heart was filled with joy, and he went on gaily. He
himself knew not whither he went. He grew hungry and more hungry, until
he was ravenous.</p>
<p>At last he saw a fire: he went up, and there was burning
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>a huge fire, over which hung a kettle of arrack,
and food cooking; around it lay nine <i>devis</i>, who were brothers.
They were fast asleep, but there was a lame one watching as sentinel.
The prince did not wait to ask leave of the <i>devis</i>; he came up,
lifted the pot off the fire, took some food, and when he had eaten, put
the pot back. He then lay down and began to snore loudly. The lame
<i>devi</i> looked on with amazement from a distance.</p>
<p>A short time afterwards a <i>devi</i> awoke. He looked round and saw
a human being sleeping there. He said joyfully: <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1564" title="Not in source">&lsquo;</span>This will be a dainty
morsel for us,&rsquo; and went towards the boy. But the lame
<i>devi</i> followed him and said: &lsquo;Leave him alone, lay not a
hand upon him; he is to be feared&mdash;just now he took our pot from
the fire, ate some food, and placed it on the fire again; he has done
alone what is difficult for us ten.&rsquo; The <i>devi</i> thought
better of it, and turned away.</p>
<p>A second <i>devi</i> then rose and did the same, but the lame
<i>devi</i> prevented him. As each <i>devi</i> awoke he went to the
boy, but the lame <i>devi</i> took care of them.</p>
<p>When all the <i>devis</i> were roused and had begun to eat, the
prince woke up too. He came to the <i>devis</i> and asked them to swear
brotherhood. The <i>devis</i> said: &lsquo;Who art thou, who art so
courageous? What brought thee here?&rsquo; The prince answered:
&lsquo;I was hungry, I saw the fire and I came to the fire.&rsquo; Then
the <i>devis</i> said: &lsquo;Very well, if thou wishest us to swear
brotherhood with thee, first go till thou findest cross roads, there a
maiden spreads out a handkerchief; if thou seizest this handkerchief
and bringest it here, we shall swear brotherhood with thee; if thou
failest, thou art none of us. Many have tried to take this
handkerchief, but the maiden always kills them.&rsquo; The <i>devis</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>thought that the prince would be killed too, and
that they would thus get rid of him.</p>
<p>The prince set out and came to the cross roads, and, behold, a
beautiful maiden flew down; a handkerchief was spread out in front of
her, and hid her from his eyes. The prince came up and seized the
handkerchief, but just as he was going away, the maiden attacked him.
The prince was victorious in the fight. After the combat a golden
slipper was left in the prince&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>He came to the <i>devis</i> with the handkerchief, and gave them the
golden slipper, saying: &lsquo;Go to the town, change this for money,
and bring it home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i>devis</i> sent the lame <i>devi</i> with the golden slipper.
When he reached the town he met a merchant, to whom he showed the
slipper. The merchant complained and said: &lsquo;My wife had golden
slippers, thou must have stolen this one.&rsquo; The <i>devi</i> said
that they had found the slipper&mdash;he swore, but the merchant would
not believe him. He took the slipper, and locked up the lame
<i>devi</i>.</p>
<p>For a long time the other <i>devis</i> waited for their lame
brother; they watched, but no lame <i>devi</i> was to be seen. Then
they sent the ninth brother to seek him. When he arrived in the town
where the <i>devi</i> had gone to exchange the golden slipper, he
enquired after his lame brother. Hearing him ask for a lame
<i>devi</i>, they said: &lsquo;This must be an accomplice of the
thief,&rsquo; and they locked him up too.</p>
<p>The remaining <i>devis</i> waited for their ninth brother, and when
they saw that he did not come, the eighth was sent, but he also was
taken; then the seventh, sixth, fifth, fourth, third, second, and at
last the first <i>devi</i> went, but none of them returned.</p>
<p>The prince said to himself: &lsquo;What can have happened
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>to these <i>devis</i>? I will go and seek them,
and perchance find out what misfortune has overtaken them.&rsquo; So he
arose and went forth.</p>
<p>The merchant heard some one was again asking for the lame
<i>devi</i>, and wished to entrap him, but the prince said: &lsquo;If I
do not find the neighbour to the golden slipper, thou mayst call us
liars, and do what thou wilt to the <i>devis</i> and me; but if I find
it thou hast lied, and we shall do what we wish to thee.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Agreed!&rsquo; said the merchant, and the prince went forth to
seek the other golden slipper.</p>
<p>He travelled far, and came at last to a kingdom by the seashore.
This kingdom was ruled by a maiden, fair as the sun. Whoever came to
that kingdom to sell wheat was met by the maiden, who cast the wheat
and its owner into the sea, and there was no escape.</p>
<p>When the prince heard of this, he said to himself: &lsquo;I shall
bring wheat to this country, and see what the fair one can do.&rsquo;
He went for the wheat, and filled a boat with grain, seated himself in
another boat, and set out for the kingdom. On nearing the shore there
appeared, from no one knows where, a beautiful damsel. She stretched
out her hand, and was about to sink the grain, when the prince struck
the boat with his foot and upset it. Then he seized the maiden&rsquo;s
hand and drew her towards him. She, seeing that she was outwitted,
pulled with all her might, and escaped from his hands, but left her
rings behind her.</p>
<p>Thus was the maiden defeated. After this, whoever wished to bring
wheat brought it, and there was plenty in that kingdom.</p>
<p>The people of the country fell down and kissed the knees of the
prince, saying: &lsquo;We beseech thee, be our king.&rsquo; But he
would not, and replied: &lsquo;I am come on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>other
business, I wish for nothing but to find a certain slipper,&rsquo; and
he told his tale. The slipper could not be found, so he arose and left
that land.</p>
<p>He went on again and came into another country. Here he learnt that
a beautiful maiden had killed the king&rsquo;s son, who was buried in a
vault. Every night the maiden came there and beat him with twigs. When
she did this he came back to life, they supped together, and passed the
time merrily until morning, when she again beat him with twigs. Then he
became a corpse, and she flew away.</p>
<p>When the prince heard this tale, he went to aid the unfortunate
youth. He entered the tomb and waited. Behold, a lovely damsel flew
down, took twigs from her pocket, and beat the king&rsquo;s son until
he came back to life; they supped and made merry until morning. As she
was about to beat the youth and kill him again, the prince snatched the
twigs from her hand; so the king&rsquo;s son lived. Then the prince
took him away, and led him to his father.</p>
<p>Here, too, the prince was offered the throne, but he did not wish to
be king. &lsquo;If I could find a certain golden slipper, I should be
happy,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I must go forth and seek it.&rsquo; And
he set forth on his quest again.</p>
<p>When he had gone some way, he came to a wide plain. He presently saw
a beautiful house, and said to himself: &lsquo;I wonder who lives
there,&rsquo; and he went on towards the house. On the way he saw an
Arab feeding some mules, and said: &lsquo;Canst thou tell me whose
house that is, brother?&rsquo; The Arab looked round about and replied:
&lsquo;Shall I swallow thee head first or feet first?&rsquo; &lsquo;I
asked thee about the house, why wilt thou not answer?&rsquo; said the
prince. Again the Arab stared round and said: &lsquo;Shall I swallow
thee by the head or by the feet?&rsquo; &lsquo;As to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>matter
of swallowing, I shall soon show thee what I shall do,&rsquo; said the
prince, giving the Arab such a blow that it sent him over nine
mountains. Then he struck the mules, and went to the house.</p>
<p>He wandered all round it, and was much delighted with its
appearance. Then he went inside through a window, and visited every
room. In one of these he saw a golden throne, and on it were golden
slippers like the one he sought. He said to himself: &lsquo;Perhaps
this is the house of the fair damsel who gave me the slipper. I shall
wait and see what happens.&rsquo; He sat under the throne and
waited.</p>
<p>Soon after, there flew in a beautiful maiden, then another, yet a
third, and at last the Arab. They sat down to eat. In the twinkling of
an eye the Arab laid the cloth for the sisters, and whatever heart or
soul could wish was spread upon it.</p>
<p>After a short time the eldest sister took wine and said: &lsquo;May
God grant long life to the youth who took from me the handkerchief and
the golden slipper.&rsquo; She drank, and put the bowl down.</p>
<p>Then the second sister took it and said: &lsquo;Long life to the
youth who snatched the rings from my hand, and gave wheat to a
kingdom.&rsquo; She drank, and put the bowl down.</p>
<p>Then the youngest sister took it and said: &lsquo;Long life to the
youth who took the twigs from my hand, and restored life to a
prince.&rsquo; She drank, and put the bowl down.</p>
<p>At last the Arab took the wine and said: &lsquo;Long life to the
youth who gave me a blow, and sent me over nine mountains.&rsquo; He
drank, and put the bowl down.</p>
<p>Then the prince appeared from under the throne, took the wine and
said: &lsquo;I have also toasts to propose. May God grant long life to
the maiden from whom I took the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61"
href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>handkerchief.&rsquo; He took
from his pocket the handkerchief and gave it to the eldest sister.
&lsquo;May God grant long life to the maiden from whom I took the
rings,&rsquo; and he gave the rings to the second sister. &lsquo;May
God grant long life to the maiden from whom I took the twigs.&rsquo; He
returned the twigs to the youngest sister, and turning to the Arab, he
said: &lsquo;May God grant long life to the Arab whom I struck and sent
over nine mountains.&rsquo; He drank, and put down the bowl.</p>
<p>Then the three sisters jumped up and said: &lsquo;He will marry
me.&rsquo; &lsquo;No! me.&rsquo; And they began to quarrel. The prince
said: &lsquo;Wherefore quarrel one with another? I shall wed the
youngest sister, since I am the youngest of three brothers, and you
elder shall wed my elder brothers.&rsquo; The maidens asked him:
&lsquo;What is the object of thy journey hither?&rsquo; &lsquo;To seek
for the other golden slipper, and lo! I have found it here,&rsquo;
answered the prince. &lsquo;Because of this slipper, nine brothers,
<i>devis</i>, are imprisoned in a certain town, and if I return without
it, I, too, shall be imprisoned to-day with them.&rsquo; &lsquo;This
slipper is thine, and as many more as thou wishest, take them with
thee, seat thyself on the Arab&rsquo;s back, and in three hours thou
wilt be in the town,&rsquo; said the sisters.</p>
<p>The prince did as they told him. He filled a bag with golden
slippers, sat on the Arab&rsquo;s back, and in three hours he was in
the town.</p>
<p>The <i>devis</i> rejoiced greatly. They called the merchant, and he
brought slippers. He took one by one his own slippers, but, behold, not
one of them would fit the golden slipper. Then, when the prince
produced his bagful of golden slippers, the merchant was proved a
liar.</p>
<p>The prince gave the merchant into the hands of the <i>devis</i>,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>and said: &lsquo;Do to him what ye please, sell
all his possessions, but I must go at once on my way.&rsquo; When the
<i>devis</i> heard this, they begged him to stay with them. But he
would not consent.</p>
<p>The prince came to the three beautiful sisters, and married the
youngest. The sisters gave the Arab a saddle bag in which was
everything for the journey, placed in his hand a tree, and said:
&lsquo;Go to the kingdom of the prince&rsquo;s father, and when thou
art near the palace, in such and such a place, plant this tree. It will
turn into a great plane tree, and underneath, a beautiful stream will
flow; there, on the banks of the stream, lay the cloth, and prepare
everything for our coming.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Arab did everything as he was commanded. Then the maidens came.
Every man and woman in the kingdom heard of this, and went out to look
at them. The parents were mourning for their long-lost son.</p>
<p>The cup of water had not changed to blood, but they had given up all
hope of finding him. At last they could stand it no longer, and they
too went to see the maidens.</p>
<p>When the prince saw his mother and father approach, he feigned
surprise, and asked why they mourned. They answered that they had lost
a son, and therefore they mourned. The prince said: &lsquo;I am your
long-lost son.&rsquo; The king and queen rejoiced, and took him home.
They prepared such a wedding that the roof of the palace resounded with
merriment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=

<p class="first">There was and there was not, there was a miserable
peasant. He had a wife and a little daughter. So poor was this peasant
that his daughter was called Conkiajgharuna (the little girl in
rags).</p>
<p>Some time passed, and his wife died. He was unhappy before, but now
a greater misfortune had befallen him. He grieved and grieved, and at
last he said to himself: &lsquo;I will go and take another wife; she
will mind the house, and tend my orphan child.&rsquo; So he arose and
took a second wife, but this wife brought with her a daughter of her
own. When this woman came into her husband&rsquo;s house and saw his
child, she was angry in heart.</p>
<p>She treated Conkiajgharuna badly. She petted her own daughter, but
scolded her stepdaughter, and tried to get rid of her. Every day she
gave her a piece of badly-cooked bread, and sent her out to watch the
cow, saying: &lsquo;Here is a loaf; eat of it, give to every wayfarer,
and bring the loaf home whole.&rsquo; The girl went, and felt very
miserable.</p>
<p>Once she was sitting sadly in the field, and began to weep bitterly.
The cow listened, and then opened its mouth, and said: &lsquo;Why art
thou weeping? what troubles thee?&rsquo; The girl told her sad tale.
The cow said: &lsquo;In one of my horns is honey, and in the other is
butter, which thou canst take if thou wilt, so why be unhappy?&rsquo;
The girl took the butter and the honey, and in a short time she grew
plump. When the stepmother noticed this she did not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>know
what to do for rage. She rose, and after that every day she gave her a
basket of wool with her; this wool was to be spun and brought home in
the evening finished. The stepmother wished to tire the girl out with
toil, so that she should grow thin and ugly.</p>
<p>Once when Conkiajgharuna was tending the cow, it ran away on to a
roof.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1757src" href="#xd21e1757" name=
"xd21e1757src">2</a> The girl pursued it, and wished to drive it back
to the road, but she dropped her spindle on the roof. Looking inside
she saw an old woman seated, and said to her: &lsquo;Good mother, wilt
thou give me my spindle?&rsquo; The old dame replied: &lsquo;I am not
able, my child, come and take it thyself.&rsquo; This old woman was a
<i>devi</i>.</p>
<p>The girl went in and was lifting up her spindle, when the old dame
called out: &lsquo;Daughter, daughter, come and look at my head a
moment, I am almost eaten up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl came and looked at her head. She was filled with horror;
all the worms in the earth seemed to be crawling there. The little girl
stroked her head and removed some, and then said: &lsquo;Thou hast a
clean head, why should I look at it?&rsquo; This conduct pleased the
old woman very much, and she said: &lsquo;When thou goest hence, go
along such and such a road, and in a certain place thou wilt see three
springs&mdash;one white, one black, and one yellow. Pass by the white
and black, and put thy head in the yellow and lave it with thy
hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl did this. She went on her way, and came to the three
springs. She passed by the white and black, and bathed her head with
her hands in the yellow fountain. When she looked up she saw that her
hair was quite golden, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"
name="pb65">65</a>]</span>and her hands, too, shone like gold. In the
evening, when she went home, her stepmother was filled with fury. After
this she sent her own daughter with the cow. Perhaps the same good
fortune would visit her!</p>
<p>So Conkiajgharuna stayed at home while her stepsister drove out the
cow. Once more the cow ran on to the roof. The girl pursued it, and her
spindle fell down. She looked in, and, seeing the <i>devi</i> woman,
called out: &lsquo;Dog of an old woman! here! come and give me my
spindle!&rsquo; The old woman replied: &lsquo;I am not able, child,
come and take it thyself.&rsquo; When the girl came near, the old woman
said: &lsquo;Come, child, and look at my head.&rsquo; The girl came and
looked at her head, and cried out: &lsquo;Ugh! what a horrid head thou
hast! Thou art a disgusting old woman!&rsquo; The old woman said:
&lsquo;I thank thee, my child; when thou goest on thy way thou wilt see
a yellow, a white, and a black spring. Pass by the yellow and the white
springs, and lave thy head with thy hands in the black one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The girl did this. She passed by the yellow and white springs, and
bathed her head in the black one. When she looked at herself she was
black as a negro, and on her head there was a horn. She cut it off
again and again, but it grew larger and larger.</p>
<p>She went home and complained to her mother, who was almost frenzied,
but there was no help for it. Her mother said to herself: &lsquo;This
is all the cow&rsquo;s fault, so it shall be killed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This cow knew the future. When it learned that it was to be killed,
it went to Conkiajgharuna and said: &lsquo;When I am dead, gather my
bones together and bury them in the earth. When thou art in trouble
come to my grave, and cry aloud: &ldquo;Bring my steed and my royal
robes!&rdquo;&rsquo; Conkiajgharuna <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>did exactly as the cow had told
her. When it was dead she took its bones and buried them in the
earth.</p>
<p>After this, some time passed. One holiday the stepmother took her
daughter, and they went to church. She placed a trough in front of
Conkiajgharuna, spread a <i>codi</i> (80 lbs.) of millet in the
courtyard, and said: &lsquo;Before we come home from church fill this
trough with tears, and gather up this millet, so that not one grain is
left.&rsquo; Then they went to church.</p>
<p>Conkiajgharuna sat down and began to weep. While she was crying a
neighbour came in and said: &lsquo;Why art thou in tears? what is the
matter?&rsquo; The little girl told her tale. The woman brought all the
brood-hens and chickens, and they picked up every grain of millet, then
she put a lump of salt in the trough and poured water over it.
&lsquo;There, child,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;these are thy tears! Now
go and enjoy thyself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Conkiajgharuna then thought of the cow. She went to its grave and
called out: &lsquo;Bring me my steed and my royal robes!&rsquo; There
appeared at once a horse and beautiful clothes. Conkiajgharuna put on
the garments, mounted the horse, and went to the church.</p>
<p>There all the folk began to stare at her. They were amazed at her
grandeur. Her stepsister whispered to her mother when she saw her:
&lsquo;This girl is very much like our Conkiajgharuna!&rsquo; Her
mother smiled scornfully and said: &lsquo;Who would give that
sun-darkener such robes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Conkiajgharuna left the church before any one else; she changed her
clothes in time to appear before her stepmother in rags. On the way
home, as she was leaping over a stream, in her haste she let her
slipper fall in.</p>
<p>A long time passed. Once when the king&rsquo;s horses were drinking
water in this stream, they saw the shining slipper, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>and were
so afraid that they would drink no more water. The king was told that
there was something shining in the stream, and that the horses were
afraid.</p>
<p>The king commanded his divers to find out what it was. They found
the golden slipper, and presented it to the king. When he saw it he
commanded his viziers, saying: &lsquo;Go and seek the owner of this
slipper, for I will wed none but her.&rsquo; His viziers sought the
maiden, but they could find no one whom the slipper would fit.</p>
<p>Conkiajgharuna&rsquo;s stepmother heard this, adorned her daughter,
and placed her on a throne. Then she went and told the king that she
had a daughter whose foot he might look at, it was exactly the model
for the shoe. She put Conkiajgharuna in a corner, with a big basket
over her. When the king came into the house he sat down on the basket,
in order to try on the slipper.</p>
<p>Conkiajgharuna took a needle and pricked the king from under the
basket. He jumped up, stinging with pain, and asked the stepmother what
she had under the basket. The stepmother replied: &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis
only a turkey I have there.&rsquo; The king sat down on the basket
again, and Conkiajgharuna again stuck the needle into him. The king
jumped up, and cried out: &lsquo;Lift the basket, I will see
underneath!&rsquo; The stepmother entreated him, saying: &lsquo;Do not
blame me, your majesty, it is only a turkey, and it will run
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the king would not listen to her entreaties. He lifted the
basket up, and Conkiajgharuna came forth, and said: &lsquo;This slipper
is mine, and fits me well.&rsquo; She sat down, and the king found that
it was indeed a perfect fit. Conkiajgharuna became the king&rsquo;s
wife, and her shameless stepmother was left with a dry throat.

<p class="first">There was, and there was not at all (of God&rsquo;s
best may it be!), there was once a woman. This woman&rsquo;s husband
had died young, and left her four little children: three boys and one
girl.</p>
<p>When the children were grown up, their mother said: &lsquo;Children,
why do you not look after your patrimony? why do you leave it thus
abandoned?&rsquo; The children did not know anything about this
patrimony, and asked their mother where it was. The mother told them
that it was in such and such a place, but the children would have to go
a long way. They asked their mother: &lsquo;Since it is so far, when we
go to work, who will bring us our food and drink?&rsquo; The mother
answered: &lsquo;I shall send your sister with your food.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The brothers were pleased with their mother&rsquo;s proposal, and
made ready to start. Their mother gave them onion and garlic with them,
and said: &lsquo;As you are going along, cut the skin off and drop it:
when your sister brings your food she will see it, and know where to
find you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The brothers went to work, and on the path they threw down the skins
as their mother had suggested.</p>
<p>Near this path there lived a <i>devi</i> with a hundred heads. Once
the <i>devi&rsquo;s</i> mother saw the onion peelings strewed on the
path; she collected them all, and put them on the road leading to her
house. Three days passed, and the mother thought that her sons&rsquo;
food must be nearly finished. She prepared some more for them, put it
in a bag, gave it to her <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href=
"#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>daughter, and sent her to her
brothers. The girl set out and followed the onion peelings.</p>
<p>She went on and on and came to a house. In the house was seated an
old woman. The girl cried out: &lsquo;Mother, mother, canst thou tell
me if my brothers are working here?&rsquo; &lsquo;What dost thou want
with thy brothers here?&rsquo; said the old woman. &lsquo;This is the
house of a <i>devi</i> with a hundred heads; he will soon be coming
home, so I had better hide thee, for if he sees thee he will eat
thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i>devi&rsquo;s</i> mother took the maiden and hid her. The
<i>devi</i> appeared, no one knows whence. He carried dead game and
firewood. He unbound them from his back, went in, and said:
&lsquo;Mother, I smell a man! Who has come hither?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why
dost thou ask?&rsquo; said the old woman; &lsquo;for fear of thee bird
cannot fly in heaven, nor can worm creep on earth.&rsquo; The
<i>devi</i> insisted, and his mother at last gave way, and said:
&lsquo;I have here a maiden whom I wish thee to marry; if thou wilt not
eat her, I will let thee see her.&rsquo; The son promised, and his
mother brought the girl out. When the <i>devi</i> saw her, he liked her
very much, and did not eat her.</p>
<p>The brothers waited and waited for their sister, and when she did
not come they rose and went home. They reproached their mother, saying:
&lsquo;Why hast thou not sent us food?&rsquo; When their mother heard
them say this, she began to weep, and said: &lsquo;Near the road dwells
a hundred-headed <i>devi</i>, and I fear that he&mdash;may he be
cursed!&mdash;has eaten her.&rsquo; The brothers did not know of this
<i>devi</i>, and when they heard about him they arose and went forth to
deliver their sister.</p>
<p>When they had gone a good way, they neared the house of the
<i>devi</i>. At that time their sister and the <i>devi&rsquo;s</i>
mother were sitting on the roof. The <i>devi&rsquo;s</i> mother saw
them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>coming in the distance, and said to her
daughter-in-law: &lsquo;Look there! dost thou see nothing
coming?&rsquo; Her daughter-in-law replied: &lsquo;I see something like
a swarm of flies.&rsquo; &lsquo;Woe to their mother and to my
son&rsquo;s mother!&rsquo; said the <i>devi</i>&rsquo;s mother, and
asked her again, in a short time, what she saw. The <i>devi</i>&rsquo;s
wife answered: &lsquo;I see three men.&rsquo; &lsquo;Woe to their
mother and to my son&rsquo;s mother!&rsquo; moaned the old woman.</p>
<p>The three brothers came at last to the <i>devi</i>&rsquo;s house.
There they saw water, but they could not cross it by any means. They
threw in stones, and stepped over in this way. Then the girl saw that
they were her brothers; she came down and embraced them. When the
<i>devi</i>&rsquo;s mother learnt who they were, she took them in, gave
them food, and then hid them, saying: &lsquo;If my son comes home and
sees you he will eat you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the hundred-headed <i>devi</i> came, no one knows whence. On
one shoulder he had firewood, and on the other dead game. At the door
he undid his burden, and, when he came in, said: &lsquo;I smell a man;
who has come hither?&rsquo; His mother tried to hide the truth, but her
son would not leave her alone, so at last she said: &lsquo;If thou wilt
promise not to eat thy wife&rsquo;s brothers, I will show them to
thee.&rsquo; The <i>devi</i> promised, and the old woman brought in the
three brothers.</p>
<p>A little while after, the <i>devi</i> said to his wife&rsquo;s
brothers: &lsquo;Come, let us prepare supper.&rsquo; They all came and
began to skin the game the <i>devi</i> had brought. Whilst the three
brothers skinned one stag, the <i>devi</i> skinned sixty, cut them up
and threw them into the pot. Then he came, seized the stag his
brothers-in-law were skinning, and threw it also into the pot.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>When they sat down to supper, the <i>devi</i> asked his wife&rsquo;s
brothers: &lsquo;Are you eaters of bone or eaters of flesh?&rsquo; They
answered: &lsquo;What have we to do with flesh? Bones are good enough
for us.&rsquo; The <i>devi</i> filled his mouth, tore off the flesh,
and threw the bones to the three brothers. Then he again inquired:
&lsquo;Will you drink out of a <i>doki</i><a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1923src" href="#xd21e1923" name="xd21e1923src">2</a> or out of a
<i>qantsi</i>?&rsquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1931src" href=
"#xd21e1931" name="xd21e1931src">3</a> &lsquo;From a
<i>qantsi</i>,&rsquo; replied the brothers. The <i>devi</i> poured out
a <i>doki</i> of wine for himself, while he filled the <i>qantsi</i>
for them.</p>
<p>When they had finished supper, and were preparing to go to bed, the
<i>devi</i> again inquired: &lsquo;Do you wish to sleep in a bed or in
the stable?&rsquo; &lsquo;What have we to do with a bed? put us in the
stable!&rsquo; replied the brothers. The <i>devi</i> lay down in his
bed, and the brothers slept in the stable. In the morning, when the
<i>devi</i> awoke, he said to his mother: &lsquo;Mother, I am
hungry!&rsquo; The mother saw his meaning, and not wishing to let her
daughter-in-law understand, she thus replied: &lsquo;Go, son, to the
stable; there, in the bread-box, are three badly-cooked loaves. Take
them and eat them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i>devi</i> went into the stable where the brothers lay. He
swallowed one of them in the doorway, put the other two in his pocket,
and went into the wood.</p>
<p>In the meantime the mother of the brothers waited and waited, and
when they did not come back, she thought: &lsquo;The <i>devi</i> must
have eaten my sons.&rsquo; She wept bitterly, her tears flowed until
they reached to heaven. At that moment a man was passing by. He asked
the cause of the tears, and the woman told him that they were for the
loss of her children.</p>
<p>Then the man gave her an apple, and said: &lsquo;Cut this apple into
a hundred pieces, and every day eat three; when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>the
apple is finished, thou shalt have a son, and thou shalt call his name
Asphurtzela.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman did as he said. She cut the apple into a hundred pieces,
and every day ate three. When the apple was finished, she brought forth
a son, and called him by the name of Asphurtzela. Asphurtzela grew as
much in a day as other children grow in a year.</p>
<p>Once when Asphurtzela was playing with a group of little boys, a
woman passed by with a <i>coca</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1980src"
href="#xd21e1980" name="xd21e1980src">4</a> full of water on her
shoulder. Just then Asphurtzela threw his <i lang=
"ka-latn">codchi</i>;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1988src" href=
"#xd21e1988" name="xd21e1988src">5</a> the <i lang="ka-latn">codchi</i>
whirled through the air, struck the woman&rsquo;s <i>coca</i> and broke
it. The woman was angry, and called out: &lsquo;Mayst thou be cursed!
But how can I curse thee, only son of thy mother? For this trick may
thy brothers and sister never be delivered from the claws of the
<i>devi</i>!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Asphurtzela did not understand this. He hastened inside, and said to
his mother: &lsquo;Give me to suck, mother!&rsquo; &lsquo;What a time
to ask such a thing,&rsquo; said his mother. But the boy would not
wait, so his mother gave him his wish.</p>
<p>Asphurtzela bit his mother&rsquo;s breast, and said: &lsquo;Tell me,
mother, have I any brothers?&rsquo; His mother did not wish him to
know, but she was in such pain that she told him everything. When
Asphurtzela heard her tale, he prepared to go away. His mother
entreated him not to leave her, but the boy would not be persuaded, and
set out.</p>
<p>He wandered far and near, and came to an open field, where he saw
men ploughing the ground. He shouted out to them: &lsquo;Take care,
save yourselves, a hundred-headed <i>devi</i> is coming!&rsquo; The men
were filled with terror, and fled in all directions. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span></p>
<p>Asphurtzela slung the plough over his back, took it to a smith, and
said: &lsquo;Make me out of this iron a pair of shoes and a bow and
arrow.&rsquo; The smith did so; Asphurtzela put on the iron shoes, took
the bow and arrow, and went in quest of the hundred-headed
<i>devi</i>.</p>
<p>He went some distance and approached the <i>devi&rsquo;s</i> house.
At that time the <i>devi&rsquo;s</i> mother was sitting on the roof,
and, seeing some one coming, she said to her daughter-in-law:
&lsquo;Dost thou see any one, or do my eyes deceive me?&rsquo; When her
daughter-in-law assured her that it was some one, the
<i>devi&rsquo;s</i> mother moaned: &lsquo;Woe to his mother&rsquo;s
breast, and woe to my son&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s breast!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime Asphurtzela arrived quite near the house, leaped
over the stream, and came to the door. He saw there a young girl, and
said: &lsquo;Surely thou art my sister!&rsquo; The girl only knew her
three brothers, and would not admit this, but when Asphurtzela told her
his tale, she believed him.</p>
<p>Then the <i>devi&rsquo;s</i> mother came and said: &lsquo;Come,
child, I will put thee in safety and hide thee, lest my son eat thee
when he comes home.&rsquo; &lsquo;Go in there, dog of an old woman! May
God bring thee and thy son to shame!&rsquo; said Asphurtzela, and he
waited impatiently for the return of the <i>devi</i>.</p>
<p>Just then the <i>devi</i> appeared, with game slung over his
shoulder, and tree roots thrust under his arm. When he saw a strange
boy standing boldly in front of his house, he said to himself:
&lsquo;For fear of me bird dare not fly in heaven nor worm creep on
earth. Who can this boy be who is strutting about so
carelessly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i>devi</i> was mad with fury when he saw him. Flames shot from
his eyes; he cast an angry glance at him, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>shouted
out: &lsquo;Who art thou? and what art thou doing here?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Shall I tell thee who I am? I am thy wife&rsquo;s brother; I am
come to be thy guest, so thou must be my host,&rsquo; said Asphurtzela.
&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; returned the <i>devi</i>, &lsquo;come in and
let us prepare supper. We must skin the game and cook it.&rsquo; They
began to skin the game, but by the time the <i>devi</i> had skinned one
beast, Asphurtzela had finished all the game, thrown it into the pot
and cooked it.</p>
<p>The <i>devi</i> gazed on Asphurtzela in unfeigned astonishment. When
the food was cooked, and they sat down to supper, the <i>devi</i>,
according to his custom, put the question to his guest: &lsquo;Art thou
an eater of bones or of flesh?&rsquo; &lsquo;Pass me over the flesh,
why should I eat bones? am I a dog that I should do this?&rsquo;
answered Asphurtzela. The <i>devi</i> gave him flesh, and inquired:
&lsquo;Wilt thou drink out of a <i>qantsi</i> or out of a
<i>doki</i>?&rsquo; &lsquo;Pass over the <i>doki</i>, why should I take
a <i>qantsi</i>?&rsquo; The <i>devi</i> gave him the <i>doki</i>, and
sank into deep thought. When it was time to go to bed, the <i>devi</i>
inquired: &lsquo;Wilt thou sleep in the stable or in a bed?&rsquo;
&lsquo;I am a man, what should I do in the stable? Give me a
bed,&rsquo; said Asphurtzela.</p>
<p>So it came to pass that Asphurtzela slept in the bed, and the
<i>devi</i> lay down in the stable. He lay down, but, alas! he could
not sleep. His one idea was how he could rid himself of this
disagreeable guest. When he thought that Asphurtzela must be asleep, he
took a huge sword and began to sharpen it. The noise of the sharpening
awoke Asphurtzela, and he, guessing the <i>devi&rsquo;s</i> design,
jumped out of bed, and put a log of wood under the coverlet. Then he
hid in the room. When the <i>devi</i> had made his sword as bright as a
diamond, he stole out quietly, opened the door, and went noiselessly
towards Asphurtzela&rsquo;s bed. He raised <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>his
sword with all his might and main, and struck with such force that all
the dust in the bed was raised, and the log was cleft through the
middle. Then the <i>devi</i> went away and closed the door.</p>
<p>Asphurtzela shook down his bed and slept peacefully. In the morning,
when the <i>devi</i> awoke and saw his brother-in-law, he gazed on him
in amazement, and said: &lsquo;Didst thou feel any pain in the
night?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; said Asphurtzela. &lsquo;Not even a
flea-bite?&rsquo; &lsquo;No.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then let us wrestle.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Asphurtzela, and the combat began.</p>
<p>The <i>devi</i> struggled and struggled, but could not move his
brother-in-law. Then Asphurtzela attacked him, and buried him in the
ground up to the neck. He took his bow and arrow, aimed at the
<i>devi</i>, and cried out: &lsquo;Tell me quickly what thou hast done
with my brothers, or I shall shoot thee.&rsquo; The <i>devi</i> was
afraid, and said: &lsquo;Do not kill me and I shall tell thee. In my
breast is a little coffer, in it they are lying dead; there too is a
handkerchief, place it on them, and they will become alive
again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When Asphurtzela heard this, he cut open the <i>devi&rsquo;s</i>
breast, took out the coffer, brought out his brothers, placed a
handkerchief on them, and they came back to life. Then he shot his
arrow at the hundred-headed <i>devi</i> and killed him. When he had cut
him into small pieces, he went to the <i>devi&rsquo;s</i> mother and
killed her too. Then he learnt his brothers&rsquo; story, and told them
his in return.</p>
<p>The brothers believed Asphurtzela, but envy entered their hearts
when they found how much braver he was than they. At last they all
arose and went towards home. On the way they had to pass through an
open field, where there grew a tree, so large that all the field was
under its shade. Asphurtzela said to his brothers and sister:
&lsquo;Let us rest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"
name="pb76">76</a>]</span>here, I am very tired and would close my eyes
a little.&rsquo; The brothers consented.</p>
<p>Asphurtzela lay down at the foot of the tree and slept like the
dead. His brothers sat down near him, and began to whisper one to
another: &lsquo;Now that he has killed the hundred-headed <i>devi</i>,
what good can he do us? Come, let us bind him to this tree and leave
him here.&rsquo; They took withs, twisted them round and round, and
bound him to the tree, so hard that blood poured from his fingers. When
his sister saw this, she entreated them to spare him, but they would
not listen to her. They bound him tight, took their sister and went
home.</p>
<p>As soon as they were in the house, the girl told their mother
everything. The mother called down curses on her three sons.</p>
<p>When Asphurtzela woke and saw that he was bound to the tree, he
tried hard to get away, but could not move. He looked round, and saw
that his brothers were no longer there. He looked everywhere, and then
prayed to God: &lsquo;O God, if I have deceived my brothers, may this
tree become stronger, but if they have deceived me, may I pull it up by
the roots.&rsquo; When he had said this he tried again, and the tree
came up by the roots.</p>
<p>Then Asphurtzela arose and went home, bearing the tree with him. He
came to the house, and called to his brothers: &lsquo;Come out at once
and loose my hands!&rsquo; His brothers grew pale and faint from fear,
but they came out and set him free. After this Asphurtzela did not wish
to live with his brothers, and made ready to leave home. His sister and
mother entreated him to stay, but Asphurtzela would not yield.</p>
<p>He went away, and wandered on until he came to a field <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>where a
man was ploughing; when he turned up a clod he threw it into his mouth
and swallowed it. Asphurtzela gazed and gazed, and at last said:
&lsquo;Man, why dost thou swallow these clods?&rsquo; &lsquo;There is
no cause for surprise in that; Asphurtzela has killed the
hundred-headed <i>devi</i>, what is there remarkable in my swallowing
clods?&rsquo; said the clod-swallower. &lsquo;I am Asphurtzela, so let
us be as brothers,&rsquo; said Asphurtzela. They went on together.</p>
<p>When they had gone some distance they came to another field, where
there was a man with mill wheels tied to his feet, and in his pocket
were two hares. He let both the hares away, and then caught both again.
Asphurtzela gazed and gazed at the man, and then said: &lsquo;Man, what
art thou doing? how canst thou catch these hares?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Asphurtzela killed the hundred-headed <i>devi</i>, what is there
remarkable in catching two hares?&rsquo; said the
hare-catcher.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2162src" href="#xd21e2162"
name="xd21e2162src">6</a> &lsquo;Why, this is Asphurtzela, and he will
be as a brother to thee, if thou wilt,&rsquo; said the clod-swallower.
So they all went on together.</p>
<p>On the way, the comrades arranged that each should shoot his arrow
in turn, and in the place where it stuck they should eat their repast.
First of all the clod-swallower shot. His arrow stuck in a very awkward
place, but they came and took their supper there.</p>
<p>Then the hare-catcher shot his arrow, which also stuck in an awkward
place. They came to it and ate their mid-day meal.</p>
<p>Last of all Asphurtzela cast his arrow, and it stuck on the shelf of
a house where dwelt three <i>devis</i>. At that time the <i>devis</i>
were being married to three fair maidens. They saw the arrow stick in
their shelf, and stopped the weddings. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>They tried to pull the
arrow out, they struggled and struggled, but could not move it. Then
they said: &lsquo;Since we cannot pull this arrow out, let us go away,
in case he who shot it comes and takes up his abode here.&rsquo; They
left in the house only one lame <i>devi</i>, whom they hid in the
chimney.</p>
<p>The three friends came in, laid the cloth, and made ready their
supper. They threw up their caps for joy. Then they said: &lsquo;Come,
let each of us, in turn, remain at home and prepare the
food.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The first day the clod-swallower stayed in. He had prepared the food
and dressed it, when, behold! the lame <i>devi</i> came down from the
chimney, and said to the clod-swallower: &lsquo;Give me to eat and
drink.&rsquo; He gave him food. &lsquo;Give me to eat and drink,&rsquo;
said the <i>devi</i> again. He gave him food once more. When he made
the same demand a third time, the clod-swallower answered: &lsquo;If
thou eatest and drinkest everything, what shall I say to my
comrades?&rsquo; The <i>devi</i> said: &lsquo;Give me to eat and drink,
or I shall eat thee and thy provisions too.&rsquo; The clod-swallower
was afraid, and ran to the door. The <i>devi</i> sat down and finished
all the food.</p>
<p>The companions came home and saw that there was no food, but what
did it matter? They managed for that day, and the next morning left the
hare-catcher at home. The same thing happened to him as to the
clod-swallower. Then it was Asphurtzela&rsquo;s turn.</p>
<p>He prepared a quantity of different kinds of food and drink for his
companions. Then the lame <i>devi</i> came out of the chimney, and
said: &lsquo;Give me to eat and drink.&rsquo; Asphurtzela did so.
&lsquo;Give me to eat and drink,&rsquo; again said the <i>devi</i>.
Asphurtzela did so. When he asked a third <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>time, Asphurtzela said:
&lsquo;If I give thee all, what will my comrades do?&rsquo; &lsquo;If
thou wilt not give me to eat, I shall eat thee and thy food too.&rsquo;
Asphurtzela smiled to himself, took his bow and arrow, shot the
<i>devi</i> through the heart, and cut him in halves.</p>
<p>The <i>devi&rsquo;s</i> head rolled one way and his body another.
The head cried out: &lsquo;Happy is he who will follow me.&rsquo; The
body cried: &lsquo;Woe to the man who follows me.&rsquo; In the
meantime Asphurtzela&rsquo;s companions returned. They ate, and then
said: &lsquo;Let us go and see what the <i>devi&rsquo;s</i> head
promised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i>devi&rsquo;s</i> head rolled and fell into a hole.
Asphurtzela looked in and saw three lovely maidens. He was pleased, and
said: &lsquo;Let us bring them out and marry them.&rsquo; The
clod-swallower slipped in, but before he had reached the bottom he
called out: &lsquo;I burn, I burn, draw me up,&rsquo; and they took him
out. Then the hare-catcher slipped down, and the same thing happened to
him. Then came Asphurtzela&rsquo;s turn.</p>
<p>He said to his companions: &lsquo;When I call out &ldquo;I burn, I
burn,&rdquo; let me down lower into the hole.&rsquo; He called out many
times: &lsquo;I burn,&rsquo; but his companions only lowered him
farther.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2232src" href="#xd21e2232" name=
"xd21e2232src">7</a></p>
<p>He went down the hole and saw the maidens, each excelled the other,
but the youngest was certainly the most beautiful of all. He took the
eldest, and called out to the clod-swallower: &lsquo;This is
thine!&rsquo; Then he sent up the second sister, calling out to the
hare-catcher: &lsquo;This is thine!&rsquo; Last of all he was about to
send the youngest, as his wife, but she objected, saying: &lsquo;Go
thou first, then I will come, for I fear that thy comrades will betray
thee.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>Asphurtzela was obstinate, and insisted upon her
going first. &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the maiden, &lsquo;I will
go, since thou wishest me to do so, but know this, thy companions will
not draw thee up, they will shut down the covering of the hole, and
thou wilt be left here. Three streams will flow here; one black, one
blue, and one white; do not put thy head under any except white water,
lest thou be drowned.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was as she had said. When all three maidens were up, the two men
put stones at the mouth of the hole, and left Asphurtzela. He was so
indignant that he at once put his head under the black spring, and was
immediately carried to the lower regions. He wandered about here and
there, and came at last to an old woman&rsquo;s hut. He called out:
&lsquo;Mother, mother, give me some water to drink.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah,
child,&rsquo; said the old woman, &lsquo;at present there is none, we
shall have it again when the dragon has carried away our
princess.&rsquo; &lsquo;What dragon?&rsquo; said Asphurtzela. The old
woman replied: &lsquo;Our water is withheld by a dragon
(<i>gvelashapi</i>), and if we do not offer him a human victim to eat,
the water will not flow. We have all paid this debt save the king, and
to-day his daughter is to be offered up.&rsquo; &lsquo;Fetch me a
water-vessel, mother, I must hasten this minute to the well,&rsquo;
said Asphurtzela.</p>
<p>The woman prayed him not to go, but he would not hear her. The old
woman arose, and brought him vessels. Asphurtzela broke up these small
water-jars, and said: &lsquo;Hast thou no <i>kvevris</i>?<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2249src" href="#xd21e2249" name="xd21e2249src">8</a>
bring them to me.&rsquo; The old woman showed him where the
<i>kvevris</i> were. Asphurtzela took them and went away.</p>
<p>When he came to the edge of the stream, he saw a richly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>dressed
maiden seated, shedding bitter tears. He asked her the cause, and when
he learnt that this was the king&rsquo;s daughter, he said: &lsquo;I
will sleep here; when the dragon comes, wake me up.&rsquo; He laid his
head on the maiden&rsquo;s lap, and fell asleep.</p>
<p>The dragon soon appeared. The maiden was afraid to wake Asphurtzela,
and she wept more than ever. One of her tears fell on
Asphurtzela&rsquo;s cheek, and he woke. When he saw the dragon he rose
up, shot an arrow, and cut it in pieces.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2264src" href="#xd21e2264" name="xd21e2264src">9</a> The maiden,
overjoyed, immediately hastened home to her father, and said:
&lsquo;Thus and thus has it come to pass, the dragon is dead.&rsquo;
The king at first would not believe this, but when others put faith in
the story, he sent to seek the youth. He wished him to marry the
princess, and decided to give him half of the kingdom.</p>
<p>They sought, and sought, but could not find him. Then the old woman
came to the palace and said: &lsquo;Mighty sovereign! have mercy upon
me and upon my son.&rsquo; The king knew that she had no son, and said:
&lsquo;Thou hadst formerly no son, where hast thou found this
one?&rsquo; &lsquo;God has given me for my son a youth who has killed
our enemy the dragon,&rsquo; answered the old woman.</p>
<p>The king was rejoiced that the youth was found. He sent his
ministers to bring him to the palace. When Asphurtzela came, the king
offered him great presents, but he would not take them, and said:
&lsquo;If thou wilt send me back to my own land of light, I shall be
happy, this is all I desire.&rsquo; The king was very melancholy, he
entreated him, but it was of no avail, so he promised.</p>
<p>After this, Asphurtzela went again to his adopted mother. On the way
he saw a great tree, and on the top there was a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>griffin&rsquo;s (<i lang="ka-latn">phascundzi</i>)
nest. There flew down from on high a dragon, and the little birds set
up a terrified scream. When Asphurtzela saw what was about to happen,
he drew his bow, and, in the twinkling of an eye, the dragon was
dead.</p>
<p>The mother griffin flew down, and her fledglings told her what had
happened. Then the grateful griffin came to Asphurtzela and said:
&lsquo;Tell me what thou wishest, that I may do thee a service.&rsquo;
Asphurtzela said: &lsquo;I wish for nought, save to be taken again into
the land of light.&rsquo; &lsquo;It will be difficult for me, but why
should I not do this for thy sake?&rsquo; said the griffin, and
directed him to get food and prepare for the journey. Asphurtzela
returned to the king, and asked him for provisions.</p>
<p>When everything was ready, the griffin put Asphurtzela on her back
and flew off. On the way, when the griffin cried out, Asphurtzela put
food in her mouth. Just as they were about to enter the world of light,
the griffin again cried aloud. Asphurtzela had no more food left, but
he cut off the calf of his leg, and threw it into the griffin&rsquo;s
mouth. This morsel was so very tasty that the griffin did not eat it,
but kept it on the tip of her tongue.</p>
<p>When they had arrived, the griffin said: &lsquo;Now farewell! leap
down and go away.&rsquo; Asphurtzela descended and went away, but he
walked like one who is lame. The griffin said: &lsquo;What aileth thee
that thou art lame?&rsquo; He told her. Then the griffin took the piece
of flesh she had kept on her tongue, put it in its place, made it
whole, and went away.</p>
<p>Asphurtzela went to seek his comrades. He went on and on until he
came to a certain place. There he saw his two companions about to marry
the beautiful maidens. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"
name="pb83">83</a>]</span>He took aim with his bow and arrow, and
called out: &lsquo;Were the men or the women to blame?&rsquo; <a id=
"xd21e2288" name="xd21e2288"></a>The youngest sister replied:
&lsquo;How could it be the women&rsquo;s fault? It was the
men&rsquo;s.&rsquo; Asphurtzela shot his arrow and killed his two
companions. Then he took the beautiful maidens with him, married the
youngest, and gave the two elder to his brothers.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">XIII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Shepherd and the Child of Fortune</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was and there was not at all, there was a man
who had a wife. They possessed great wealth, but had no child. Once the
woman said to her husband: &lsquo;Come, let us place young bullocks in
our churches, and at night let some one watch, perhaps God will look
down upon us and give us a child.&rsquo; The husband approved of this
idea, and placed bullocks in five churches.</p>
<p>Then they went into one of the churches, killed a bullock, gave it
to their shepherd, and said: &lsquo;Go, take this bullock&rsquo;s flesh
and give it to the poor; do thou remain in the church all night and
watch. Listen very carefully.&rsquo; The shepherd went away and gave
the bullock&rsquo;s flesh to the poor; then he went into the church,
and remained the whole night watching, but he heard not a word relating
to his master&rsquo;s childlessness.</p>
<p>Day dawned, and the shepherd went and told his master: &lsquo;I have
watched the whole night, and have not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>heard a sound.&rsquo;
Then this man went into the second chapel. He killed the bullock there,
and gave it to his shepherd, who distributed it even as he had the
first. In the morning, when he went home, he brought the same answer as
before. Then they went to the third and fourth chapels, but still they
learnt nothing.</p>
<p>Only the fifth chapel remained. Here also the shepherd distributed
bullock&rsquo;s flesh to the poor, and hid himself in the church. In
the middle of the night, behold there flew down the five angels of the
churches, and began to talk together. They said: &lsquo;We must do
something for this man. He is childless; let us give him a son.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the first angel, &lsquo;but when he reaches the
age of twenty let him die and return to us.&rsquo; &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
said the second angel, &lsquo;when the priest shall lead him into the
cathedral and place a crown on his head, then he shall die.&rsquo;
&lsquo;When he has a wife and children, then he shall die,&rsquo; said
the third. &lsquo;He shall live a long time, he shall grow old, but
shall be a worthless fellow,&rsquo; said the fourth. &lsquo;If we are
to give the man a child, let us give him something better,&rsquo; said
the fifth angel. &lsquo;We have spoken, now it is thy turn; what dost
thou say?&rsquo; answered the others. &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the
fifth angel, &lsquo;let him be endowed with immortal youth, and
whatever he asks of God may it come to pass.&rsquo; &lsquo;Good,
good!&rsquo; assented the others, and they went away each to his own
place.</p>
<p>The shepherd heard all this. At daybreak he came back to his master,
who inquired of him: &lsquo;Well, didst thou hear nothing last
night?&rsquo; The shepherd replied: &lsquo;The five angels of the
churches assembled, and they said that thou shouldst have a son at the
end of a year, but it is ordained that thy shepherd shall be present at
the birth.&rsquo; &lsquo;Thank <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85"
href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>the Lord! If we have a son thou
mayst be present,&rsquo; answered the husband and wife.</p>
<p>After this the shepherd went to his sheep, and the man and woman
went in. A year passed; the shepherd delayed some time, put in his
pocket a little goat, and went away. The woman was in bed, and the
shepherd put her child in his pocket, and wrapped the young goat up in
the bedclothes. Then the shepherd opened the bedroom door and went
away. When he had gone for one or two weeks the child would not stay in
his pocket any longer, and asked to be put down. The shepherd put him
down, and he walked by himself.</p>
<p>They went on and on, and at last they became hungry. The shepherd
said to himself: &lsquo;Come, I will try if the prophecy of the angels
be true or not,&rsquo; and he said to the boy: &lsquo;Wish that God
will give us bread, that we may eat.&rsquo; The boy wished, and God
gave them bread. They sat down and ate, but they had no water. He
wished for water, and, by their side, there murmured a beautiful
spring.</p>
<p>The shepherd now believed in his heart that all his desires would be
fulfilled, and said: &lsquo;Wish that in this plain a house completely
furnished may arise, and that outside there may be a village over which
I may rule, and that I may have such and such a princess for my
wife.&rsquo; The boy wished this, and everything was according to his
desire.</p>
<p>Some time passed. Once the princess asked the shepherd, saying:
&lsquo;How has it happened that an illustrious princess like me has
married a simple shepherd?&rsquo; Her husband replied: &lsquo;Heat the
spit and put it on the sole of the boy&rsquo;s foot to see if he is
asleep. If he is, then I will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>tell thee all.&rsquo; The child heard
this conversation, and wished in his heart: &lsquo;O God! may my foot
be hardened, so that I cannot feel anything.&rsquo; The woman heated
the spit, put it on the sole of the boy&rsquo;s foot, but he did not
move. The shepherd thought that he was really asleep, and told his wife
everything in detail. The child lay quiet and listened. He now learnt
for the first time whose son he was, and how he had fallen into the
hands of the shepherd.</p>
<p>Next morning at daybreak he arose and went to seek his parents. He
went on and on, and everywhere asked news of his village. He came to
his father&rsquo;s house, and said: &lsquo;Do you want a guest?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Truly, child, a guest is of God!&rsquo; And they led him in.
Then the boy asked them: &lsquo;Have you lost anything?&rsquo; The
master of the house replied: &lsquo;Well, child, I have lost a
shepherd, and I still owe him four years&rsquo; wages.&rsquo; &lsquo;I
saw him just now coming to you with great wealth, and with a wife and
family,&rsquo; said the boy.</p>
<p>At night, when all were asleep, the boy wished in his heart:
&lsquo;O God! may the shepherd, with his house, his family, and his
town, be in our courtyard to-night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next morning the master of the house came to the door, and was
struck with surprise. &lsquo;My God!&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;how was
this town built in our courtyard?&rsquo; His wife said: &lsquo;What art
thou talking about, husband? This our courtyard, indeed! We are
somewhere else.&rsquo; The man replied: &lsquo;No, wife, this is our
own home; that is our house, but these are certainly not the usual
surroundings.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, let me look inside; if there is a boy
sleeping there it must be our house.&rsquo; The boy was awake, but
pretended to be asleep.</p>
<p>The man and woman went in and saw the boy sleeping <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>there.
They awoke him and said: &lsquo;Who art thou who hast appeared here? We
pray thee to tell us what thou hast done that we no longer know our own
house.&rsquo; The boy smiled and said: &lsquo;I told you yesterday that
your shepherd was coming to you with his possessions. Behold! he came
yesterday, and has taken up his abode in your courtyard. Let us call
this your shepherd here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At that moment the shepherd awoke. When he jumped out of bed and saw
the courtyard, he said to himself: &lsquo;Great art thou, O Lord! I was
settled in my home, and now I am here!&rsquo; He went in to his master,
bent his knee, and said: &lsquo;Thus and thus have I done; I have done
evil, and now I am in thy hands, do to me as thou wilt.&rsquo; When the
man and woman heard this tale they did not know what to do to show
their joy. First one embraced the child, then the other. At length the
boy said: &lsquo;I am in truth your son, but this man is also your
child. He has done wrong, but you will forgive all, and give him his
hire.&rsquo; His father gave the shepherd his hire, and forgave
him.</p>
<p>But still the boy was not satisfied. He said to his parents:
&lsquo;This shepherd, at least, left a goat in exchange for me; if my
mother brought up the goat, he brought me up. If you wish, keep the
goat and I will go with him; if, however, you keep me, you ought to
give him back his goat.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not only will I do that, but I
will also give him half of my flocks,&rsquo; said the boy&rsquo;s
father. He divided his flocks into two parts and gave one to his
shepherd, and took him into his house. The boy remained with his father
and mother, and they lived happily together. <span class=

<h2 class="label">XIV</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Two Thieves</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a thief called the Big Thief. Now this
Big Thief went into a town to steal. When he had gone some little
distance he met an unknown man. &lsquo;God give thee victory!<a class=
"noteref" id="n1.14.1src" href="#n1.14.1" name="n1.14.1src">1</a> Mayst
thou be victorious!&rsquo;<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n1.14.1">1</a> said they one to another. &lsquo;Who art thou, and
what is thy trade?&rsquo; inquired the Big Thief. &lsquo;My trade is
thieving, and my name is Little Thief,&rsquo; said the unknown.
&lsquo;I, too, am a thief, so let us join partnership.&rsquo; He
agreed, and they became partners.</p>
<p>And they went on together to steal. On the way, the Big Thief said
to the Little Thief: &lsquo;Now give me a proof of thy skill in
thieving.&rsquo; But the latter said: &lsquo;Thou art the Big Thief,
thou must show me thy skill; what can I do compared with thee?&rsquo;
The Big Thief consented.</p>
<p>They saw, just at that moment, a pigeon sitting on a plane tree. The
Big Thief said: &lsquo;Now you shall see me pull out the tail of that
pigeon on the plane tree without its knowledge.&rsquo; Having said
this, he went up the tree.</p>
<p>When he had gone about half way, the Little Thief silently stole
under the plane tree, climbed up, and while the Big Thief pulled out
the tail of the pigeon, the Little Thief took off his companion&rsquo;s
drawers, and promptly descended the tree.</p>
<p>When the Big Thief came down and proudly showed the pigeon&rsquo;s
tail, the Little Thief thrust his hand into his pocket and showed him
the drawers. When the Big Thief saw this, he was struck with amazement,
and said: &lsquo;Although <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href=
"#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>I am famous I do not think thou art
at all inferior to me.&rsquo; They had tried each other&rsquo;s skill,
and went on.</p>
<p>On the way, the Little Thief enquired of the Big Thief: &lsquo;What
shall we steal to-night?&rsquo; &lsquo;Let us go to-night and break
into the king&rsquo;s treasury,&rsquo; said the Big Thief. &lsquo;Very
well,&rsquo; agreed his comrade, and they set out for the town.</p>
<p>At nightfall, when the tread of people&rsquo;s feet had ceased, the
thieves took two bags, and went to break into the king&rsquo;s
treasury. The Little Thief said: &lsquo;Climb thou into the treasury,
gather up the money, I shall fill the bags, then we can take them up,
and make off.&rsquo; The Big Thief would not consent. &lsquo;No,&rsquo;
said he; &lsquo;thou art the smaller, go inside, and I shall stay
here.&rsquo; He insisted until he gained his point.</p>
<p>At last the Little Thief got in, and collected the money. The Big
Thief stayed outside and filled the bags. When the two bags were full,
he made a sign, the Little Thief came out of the treasury, they took
the bags and went home.</p>
<p>Next morning the king went into his treasury. He looked in and saw
what had happened. Then he called his council together, and made his
complaint. They planned and planned, and at last thought of the
following scheme. They took a big barrel, filled it with pitch, and
placed it at the entrance to the treasury.</p>
<p>The thieves knew nothing of this. When night came again, they
returned to steal. The Little Thief said: &lsquo;Yesterday I went into
the treasury, to-day it is thy turn, I will watch for thee.&rsquo; The
Big Thief consented. He went into the treasury, and suddenly was caught
fast. The Little Thief pulled hard, but his companion could not get
away; nothing but his head was visible; he was up to the neck in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>pitch. When day dawned, the Little Thief saw that
nothing could be done, so he took his dagger and cut off his
comrade&rsquo;s head. Then he hid it in a place where no human being
could possibly find a trace of it.</p>
<p>He went home and told his late companion&rsquo;s wife. He warned her
to be very careful, and not to go out, for if it was discovered that
they were interested in the dead man, they would most certainly be
seized and killed.</p>
<p>When day dawned, they told the king: &lsquo;A thief is caught in the
trap, but he has no head.&rsquo; The king went himself, and saw that in
truth the thief had no head, and he was amazed. How could a headless
man thieve? Then he commanded them, saying: &lsquo;Take his body and
put it in the market place, with sentinels to guard it. Whoever passes
by and weeps at the sight of it will be guilty, because it will be a
sign of pity for the thief; bring such persons to me
immediately.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the Little Thief heard this, he went home, and instructed his
companion&rsquo;s wife how to act. &lsquo;Take good care not to go out,
lest they discover thee&rsquo;; and he told her what orders the king
had given. The Big Thief&rsquo;s wife could not bear this, and
entreated him to let her go, saying: &lsquo;I will stand far away and
weep quietly, no one will recognise me.&rsquo; &lsquo;Very well, but be
careful. Take a water jug with thee as if to carry water, and when near
thy husband&rsquo;s body, strike thy foot against a stone, break the
jar, and then sit down and weep as if thou art mourning for the broken
pitcher.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The woman did exactly as she was told. She took the jar on her
shoulder and went for water. When she came near the place where her
husband&rsquo;s body was lying, she struck her foot on a stone, let the
jar fall, and it broke. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>Then she sat down by the fragments
and began to weep bitterly, apparently for the pitcher, but really for
her husband. When she had wailed enough she rose and went away. The
sentinels were amazed: &lsquo;What a miserable woman to cry thus for a
broken pitcher!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Night came on. The sentinels returned to the palace with the body of
the thief, and said to the king: &lsquo;We saw no one who wept except
one woman, who struck her foot against a stone and broke her water jar,
and for this she cried bitterly.&rsquo; The king was very angry, for he
saw the trick the woman had played. He was enraged because they had not
seized her and brought her to him, but had let her escape. Then the
king ordered the sentinels&rsquo; heads to be cut off.</p>
<p>As this ruse had not succeeded, the king thought of another. He sent
the thief&rsquo;s corpse outside the town, and left it there. Perhaps
the right person will see it and come to steal it. Sentinels were
posted, and told that if any one came to steal the corpse they should
seize him and bring him.</p>
<p>On hearing this news the Little Thief drove an ass before him into a
neighbouring village. There he had some cakes baked and turkeys and
fowls roasted, put them in the saddle bag, and hung it on the ass. Then
he bought some of the best wine and went on his way. He came to the
place where the sentinels were posted, and cried out: &lsquo;Do you not
want a guest? I have come from afar, and must stay here to-night; I
fear some one may steal the ass. Let us have a good supper.&rsquo; The
mention of supper delighted the sentinels. They sat down and began to
eat. The Little Thief poured them out wine. The sentinels drank, but
the thief did not drink a drop. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92"
href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span></p>
<p>When they had eaten well, he said to them: &lsquo;I am going to
sleep. As I am sleepy, you may watch the ass and see that no one steals
him, lest if he be lost I accuse you to the king.&rsquo; &lsquo;Lie
down and make thyself easy. This ass of thine is not so attractive that
thou needst fear for him,&rsquo; said the sentinels. The Little Thief
lay down and pretended to go to sleep, but he kept a sharp look out. A
short time afterwards the sentinels lay in a deep sleep, they slept as
if they were dead.</p>
<p>Then the Little Thief arose and lifted the body of his late
companion on his back. He brought forward his ass, put the corpse on
it, and turned its head towards home. He himself lay down again and
fell asleep.</p>
<p>The ass was accustomed to find his way home, he lowered his head as
if meditating, went straight home and knocked against the door. The Big
Thief&rsquo;s wife came and took down the dead body, put it on a couch
and wept. When her heart was solaced by tears, she buried him in the
earth under the couch.</p>
<p>When morning came, the sentries awoke and roused their false host.
The Little Thief looked round and called his ass. He saw that it was
not there, and set up a fearful howl: &lsquo;I will go and accuse you
to the king.&rsquo; The sentinels were terrified, and completely lost
their heads when they saw that the corpse was gone. They drew money
from their pockets, and offered it to silence their noisy host. This
was what he wanted; he had not only stolen the body but gained some
money.</p>
<p>The sentinels went to the king. When he heard their tale he was
extremely irritated, and ordered their heads to be cut off.</p>
<p>This new plan having failed, he thought of another. A <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>street
was strewed with money; sentinels were placed here and there, and
ordered to seize any passer-by who gathered up the money, for he would
be the thief&rsquo;s master and companion.</p>
<p>The Little Thief heard this news with joy. He got a pair of boots
tarred, and went out with them under his arm.</p>
<p>When he came to the street that was strewed with money he sat down,
took off his boots, and put on the newly-tarred boots. Then he walked
along the street boldly, singing a song. When he had got to the end of
the street, he took off the money that had stuck to his tarred boots,
made a hole in the earth and poured it in. Then he walked back to the
other end of the street, cleaned his boots again and buried the money.
He did this the whole day, and by the evening he had picked up almost
half of the money.</p>
<p>The sentinels gathered up what was left, went to the king, and said:
&lsquo;No one has taken the money, but a man was walking in the street
from morning till night.&rsquo; The king was enraged that they had not
taken this man, and ordered the sentinels to be beheaded.</p>
<p>Then he assembled his counsellors and asked their advice. Now the
king had a hind, if they were to let this animal loose it would fall on
its knees before the house of him who was guilty against the king. And
the viziers said: &lsquo;Let the hind go, and it will fall on its knees
in front of the house of the thief.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The king took this advice, and they let the hind loose.</p>
<p>It raced along the streets, and fell on its knees just in front of
the Little Thief&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>In the morning, when the Little Thief awoke, he looked out of his
window, and saw the king&rsquo;s hind kneeling in front of his house.
He had heard of this hind before, so, when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span>he saw
it, he knew what it meant. He went outside, seized hold of the hind and
drew it in; he killed it and skinned it, then he hid the skin
carefully, and kept the flesh in the house.</p>
<p>The king was mad with rage when they sought his hind and could not
find it. He assembled his viziers, and told the story of the lost hind.
The viziers&rsquo; resources were at an end now, they could think of no
other trap for the thief.</p>
<p>But there appeared, from no one knows where, an old woman. She
approached the king and said: &lsquo;What wilt thou give me if I find
the lost hind?&rsquo; &lsquo;Whatever thou askest me,&rsquo; said the
king. &lsquo;Then give me my freedom.&rsquo; &lsquo;I shall not only
give thee thy freedom, but shall raise thee to the rank of
princess,&rsquo; replied the king. The old woman rose and went forth to
seek the hind.</p>
<p>She wandered till at last she came to the Little Thief&rsquo;s
house. The Little Thief was not at home, and she saw the Big
Thief&rsquo;s wife. She said: &lsquo;Daughter, if thou hast a piece of
hind&rsquo;s flesh do not grudge it to me, it will cure a sick one of
his illness.&rsquo; The thief&rsquo;s wife did not know of the cunning
of the old woman, went into her house, and brought out a piece of
hind&rsquo;s flesh. The old woman was joyful, and did not wait. She
rose and went away.</p>
<p>When she had gone a little way, she met the Little Thief, who said:
&lsquo;What is that, old dame?&rsquo; &lsquo;A piece of hind&rsquo;s
flesh, as a remedy for my trouble! The woman in that house gave it to
me,&rsquo; said the beldam. The Little Thief understood her; he saw
through her cunning, and said: &lsquo;What is the use of this morsel of
flesh? Come with me and I can give thee a whole dishful. Thou canst eat
and give to thy friends; it will be of service to thee.&rsquo; The old
woman&rsquo;s head swam with pleasure. She turned <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>back and
went with the Little Thief. Whenever the deceitful old woman was
enticed into the house, he drew out his dagger and cut off her head.
Then he took her body, and buried it also under the couch. The king
waited for news, but the old woman never came.</p>
<p>Some time passed by, but still the old woman did not come, and the
king was enraged. He assembled his counsellors, and said: &lsquo;What
is the use of all this? Is there no way of trapping this thief?&rsquo;
The viziers said: &lsquo;This fellow is so brave, and such a clever
thief, that we cannot entrap him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then the king rose up and said: &lsquo;Let the thief come to me. I
shall not harm him, but shall give him my daughter to wife. He is so
clever that I cannot take him by trickery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the Little Thief heard this he came to the king and said:
&lsquo;I am that thief, and I am come to do your majesty&rsquo;s
will.&rsquo; The king could not break his word, so he gave him his
daughter in marriage.</p>
<p>A neighbouring monarch heard this story. Every day he wrote
irritating letters to the thief&rsquo;s father-in-law, the king,
saying: &lsquo;Are you not ashamed to have anything to do with a low
thief, to marry him to your daughter, and call him
son-in-law?...&rsquo; The king was very much annoyed at these scornful
reproaches, and at last fell ill, being able to bear them no
longer.</p>
<p>Then the king&rsquo;s son-in-law came to him and said: &lsquo;What
is the matter? Why art thou ill?&rsquo; His father-in-law told him
everything, and he replied: &lsquo;Why distress thyself? Give me a few
days&rsquo; leave, and I shall show thee a sight. Only on such and such
a day prepare a grand festival, and I shall be here.&rsquo; He fixed a
date, and went away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96"
name="pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>He travelled on until he came to the kingdom of the mocking monarch,
and he went into a house and rested. The next day he saw a tailor and
said: &lsquo;I want a robe cut out of pieces of skin; it must be all of
different colours, and I want little bells put in it.&rsquo; When the
tailor had finished the garment, the thief gave him money and sent him
away.</p>
<p>Then he clad himself in the robe, took a glittering, naked sword in
his hand, and went to the palace. The porters did not want to let him
in, but the thief said: &lsquo;I am Michael Gabriel, sent from God! I
am commanded to take the souls of your king and queen to Paradise, and
if you trouble me I shall take your souls too, and shall send them into
hell.&rsquo; He moved towards one of them, and the bells began to ring.
The porters&rsquo; hearts were fearful, and they hid themselves.</p>
<p>The thief went in to the king. When he saw the man he became pale.
Michael Gabriel said: &lsquo;I give you a term of three days. In these
three days put all your affairs in order; appoint your successor. Strip
off everything, put yourselves in coffins, and set the keys on the top.
In three days I shall come again, lock the coffins, and take them away
with me.&rsquo; When he had said this he went away, returned to the
house, took off the robe of skins, and waited three days.</p>
<p>On the third day he clothed himself as before, and went again to the
palace. The king and queen had stripped off everything, and were in the
coffins waiting. He called out: &lsquo;When you get to Paradise you
will hear a noise, then the coffins will open, and your eyes will view
a glorious scene.&rsquo; He took the keys, locked both the coffins,
took them on his back, and carried them out. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>He put them on his ass, went behind it, and called gently,
&lsquo;Gee-up!&rsquo; On the appointed day he came to the court of his
father-in-law, who had invited the whole of his kingdom and many
neighbouring princes to a great feast. The thief came, and, as he
lifted the coffins off the ass, beautiful music was heard.</p>
<p>The thief opened the coffins, and the king and queen jumped out
naked and began to dance. The people saw their stupidity, and were
ready to die with laughing. Then the king came, clothed them in royal
robes, and said: &lsquo;Now you can go back to your own country, and
rule your kingdom, but do not mock me any more.&rsquo; After this the
king loved his son-in-law very much, and, when he died, left him the
kingdom.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a king who had a son. Every one treated
him badly, and chased him away. Even passers-by looked upon him with
disfavour. The prince thought and thought, and at last he mounted his
horse, took his bow and arrow, and departed from his father&rsquo;s
palace.</p>
<p>When he had gone some distance he came into a sheltered wood. He
wandered about until he found a suitable nook. He built for himself a
mud hut, and dwelt there.</p>
<p>Every day the prince went out to hunt. He would shoot a stag or a
roebuck, and bring it home. After he had eaten as much as he wanted,
there was always enough meat left for the next day, but he never ate it
the next day, as he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98"
name="pb98">98</a>]</span>went hunting again, and there was thus always
a quantity of food left over.</p>
<p>A fox perceived this, and every day, when the prince had gone out to
the chase, he stole into the hut and ate all the food that was left;
then he stole away again. Some time passed thus. Then the fox said:
&lsquo;There is no bravery in this! I carry away all his meat secretly,
yet there is plenty. I will show myself to him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Once when the prince was hunting, the fox stole in, and, when his
hunger was satisfied, he went about arranging everything. When the
prince came home, the fox leaped out in front of him. The prince drew
his bow, and was just about to shoot him, when the fox cried out:
&lsquo;Do not kill me, and I will help to make thy fortune!&rsquo; The
prince did not kill him, and the fox attended to the horse, and led it
about, until the sweat dried off its coat. They lived thus for some
time. The fox lighted the fire, tidied the hut, and did all the
work.</p>
<p>But, in spite of this, there was still meat left. &lsquo;I will go
and find some one who will help to eat it,&rsquo; said the fox. He went
out, and saw a wolf hardly able to walk from want of food. It could
scarcely move from the spot where it was. The fox said: &lsquo;Come
home with me, and thou shalt have plenty of everything.&rsquo; The wolf
followed him. They both went into the hut, where the fox told his
companion: &lsquo;I will tidy the house, thou must stay here, and when
the master comes in attend to his horse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The master came, and on the saddle of his horse was slung a stag.
The wolf sprang out to attend to the horse; the youth drew his bow, and
was about to shoot the wolf, when the fox cried out: &lsquo;Do not kill
him, he is a friend!&rsquo; The prince did not kill him, but jumped
down from his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>horse, took the stag, and went in. The wolf
attended to the horse, and led him up and down, while the fox himself
saw to the inside of the house; thus they lived for some time.</p>
<p>The fox noticed that there was much meat left even now. He ran out
and brought in a famished bear. The wolf was sent for grass, the bear
commanded to tend the horse, while the fox arranged the house. In a
little time the prince came in, and when the bear jumped out to look
after his horse he drew his bow to shoot him, but the fox cried out:
&lsquo;Do not kill him, he is a friend!&rsquo; The youth did not kill
the bear, and he tended the horse and led it about; then the wolf came
in with the grass, and gave it to the horse.</p>
<p>Some time passed. The fox saw that even yet there was meat to spare.
He went out and sought until he found an eagle, which he brought home.
He commanded the eagle to attend to the horse, sent the bear for grass,
and the wolf for wood to burn, while he saw to household affairs. Thus
each had his business to do. When the master returned, the eagle flew
out to tend the horse. The prince was about to shoot him, when the fox
cried out: &lsquo;Do not kill him, he is a friend!&rsquo; The prince
did not kill him, but thought to himself: &lsquo;What will this vile
fox bring in next? I shall see all the game in the country here.&rsquo;
They lived thus some time.</p>
<p>Once the fox said to his master: &lsquo;Give us leave to go away for
two weeks; at the end of that time we shall return to thee.&rsquo; The
master gave them leave, and thought to himself: &lsquo;I do not mind if
I never see you again, for I am afraid of you all.&rsquo; The fox, the
wolf, the bear, and the eagle went away. They saw a glade in the wood,
and rested there. The fox said to his companions: &lsquo;Now, let
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>us build a good house for our master.&rsquo;
They all agreed, and set to work. The wolf cut down trees, the bear cut
the wood into shape, and did the joiner work, the eagle carried it, and
the fox gave orders. When the wood was ready, they set to and built the
house. They built so beautiful a house that the prince could not have
imagined one like it, even in his dreams. Everything was finished, but
there was no furniture in it.</p>
<p>The fox arose and took his companions into a neighbouring town. They
went into the bazaar, and looked at the house-furniture. Each one had
his work to do again. The fox chose the goods, the wolf was ordered to
break the shutters, the bear to carry the things to the door, and the
eagle to take everything to the palace. They seized everything
necessary for furnishing a house&mdash;domestic utensils, carpets, and
vessels. They carried them to the palace, and placed them there; so now
all was finished, and there was nothing more left to wish for.</p>
<p>Two weeks had expired, so the four went home. The prince was
hunting, but they went to meet him. They surrounded him, and would not
let him pass. The fox cried out: &lsquo;I command thee to come with us
whither we lead thee.&rsquo; The prince was afraid, he did not know
what it could mean, but went with them. In a little while they arrived
in the glade. It was girt by a wall over which no bird could fly. They
opened the gates and went inside. When the king&rsquo;s son saw, he was
stupefied with surprise. Inside the wall was laid out a beautiful
garden, with fountains playing, and there stood a magnificent palace.
Then they said: &lsquo;We have made all this ready in two weeks, now
live happily in it.&rsquo; The prince rejoiced greatly, and gave hearty
thanks to his fox. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101"
name="pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>Some time passed after this. The fox said: &lsquo;I must see if I
can find a good wife for my master.&rsquo; He came to the prince, and
again asked a fortnight&rsquo;s absence. Then he went away and made a
sledge. He harnessed the wolf and bear to it, and said to the eagle:
&lsquo;Fly up high, and keep a watch; when thou seest a beautiful
princess, seize her in thy claws and carry her off.&rsquo; He himself
sat down and acted as coachman. Thus they travelled from place to
place.</p>
<p>In the villages, the fox played the trumpet, and the bear and the
wolf leaped and danced along. Crowds of people came out to look. When
they came to the capital, a maiden, fair as the sun, looked from her
window, the eagle seized her in his claws, and flew off. The bear and
the wolf turned round and started for home. When the people saw this,
they all set off in pursuit. The fox was behind his companions, and the
dogs came nearer, and almost touched his cloak, but in some way or
other they all escaped, and brought the fair one to their master.</p>
<p>The king&rsquo;s son could scarcely stand on his feet for joy. The
princess&rsquo;s father was in the greatest consternation, and said:
&lsquo;To him who finds and brings back my daughter will I give the
half of my kingdom.&rsquo; But none was able to find trace of her. At
last an old woman appeared, and said to the king: &lsquo;I will find
thy daughter.&rsquo; She arose and went forth. At last she came to the
prince&rsquo;s house, and asked: &lsquo;Do ye not want an attendant? I
will come for small wages.&rsquo; The fox, wolf, bear, and even the
beautiful princess herself, said: &lsquo;We do not want thee, we shall
not take thee.&rsquo; But the prince did not agree with them, and
engaged her as servant.</p>
<p>The old woman served them faithfully for a long time, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>and
did not harm them. Then one day, when the prince was asleep, the old
woman wanted the princess to go out into the garden with her. She did
not wish to go, but the old woman pressed her until she consented. When
they came to the fountains, the old woman offered her some water. The
princess refused it, but the old woman insisted. She placed a
<i>litra</i> (large jar) full of water to her lips, and it suddenly
swallowed up the princess. Then the old woman put it to her own mouth,
and it swallowed her. The <i>litra</i> rolled away. The fox saw and
pursued, but that which he sought was soon lost to sight.</p>
<p>The fox reproached his master, but it was no use saying anything
now. He asked again for a fortnight&rsquo;s leave, made another sledge
like the former, and harnessed the bear and wolf to it. He sat up on
the seat, and held tambourines in his paws. He struck them, and the
wolf and bear pranced and danced along. The eagle flew up high, and
looked round. All the people in the land came out to gaze at the sight.
The king was angry with his beautiful daughter, and said, &lsquo;Do not
go out! Do not even look out.&rsquo; The eagle watched for a long time,
but could not see her. At last he caught a glimpse of the princess
through a little window; he struck against it, broke it, seized the
princess, and flew away. He rejoined his companions, and all hastened
off.</p>
<p>They brought the princess to their master. The king collected all
his army, and sent the old woman with it to the prince&rsquo;s palace.
The fox saw them appearing in the distance like a swarm of flies. He
ordered the eagle to carry stones up high in the air. When the army
approached, the eagle let the stones fall on the men; the fox, the
bear, and the wolf attacked them, and completely exterminated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>them. There escaped only one single man; they
fell upon him too, gnawed one of his feet, and said: &lsquo;Go and tell
thy king what has befallen his hosts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the king saw his man, and heard the sad end of his army, he was
out of his mind with grief. He assembled all the chief priests in his
kingdom, went in front of them, and they all came on bended knees. When
they were near, the fox saw them, and told his master. The prince ran
out to meet them, raised them all on their feet, and took them into his
house. The father and son-in-law became reconciled, and lived happily
together. Then the fox said to his master: &lsquo;I am getting old now,
and the day of my death will soon be here, promise to bury me in a
fowl-house.&rsquo; The prince promised. The fox said to himself:
&lsquo;Come, I will see if my master means to keep his promise,&rsquo;
and he stretched himself out as if he were dead. When the prince saw
the corpse, he ordered it to be taken away and thrown into the
earth.</p>
<p>The fox was enraged, jumped up and cried out: &lsquo;Is this the way
thou rememberest my goodness to thee? Well, since thou hast done thus,
when I die you will all be cursed, and there will not remain a trace of
you.&rsquo; Some time after this the fox died. After his death, his
word came to pass, and they were all destroyed. The wolf, the bear, and
the eagle remained masters of the field.<a class="noteref" id=

<p class="first">There was and there was not at all (of God&rsquo;s
best may it be!), there was a king. When the day of his death was
drawing nigh, he called his son to him, and said: &lsquo;In the day
when thou goest to hunt in the east, take this coffer, but only open it
when thou art in dire distress.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The king died, and was buried in the manner he had wished. The
prince fell into a state of grief, and would not go outside the door.
At last the ministers of state came to the new king, and proposed to
him that he should go out hunting. The king was delighted with the
idea, and set out for the chase with his suite.</p>
<p>They went eastwards, and killed a great quantity of game. On their
way home, the young monarch saw a tower near the road, and wished to
know what was in it. He asked one of his viziers to go and try to find
out about it. He obeyed, but first said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hope to return in three days, and if I do not I shall be
dead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Three days passed, and the vizier did not return. The king sent a
second, a third, a fourth, but not one of them came back. Then he rose
and went himself. When he arrived, he saw written over the door:
&lsquo;Enter and thou wilt repent; enter not and thou wilt
repent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must do one or the other,&rsquo; said the king to himself,
&lsquo;so I shall go in.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door and went in. Behold! there stood twelve men with
drawn swords. They took his hand and led him into twelve rooms. When he
was come into the twelfth, he saw a golden couch, on which was
stretched a boy of eight or nine years of age. His eyes were closed,
and he did not utter a word. The king was told: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;Thou mayst ask him three questions, but if he does not
understand and answer all of them, thou must lose thy head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The king became very sad, but at last remembered the coffer his
father had given him. &lsquo;What greater misfortune can I have than to
lose my head?&rsquo; said he to himself. He took out the coffer and
opened it; from it there fell out an apple, which rolled towards the
couch. &lsquo;What help can this be to me?&rsquo; said the king.</p>
<p>But the apple began to speak, and told the following tale to the
boy:&mdash;&lsquo;A certain man was travelling with his wife and
brother, when night fell, and they had no food. The woman&rsquo;s
brother-in-law went into a neighbouring village to buy bread; on the
way he met brigands, who robbed him and cut off his head. When his
brother did not return, the man went to look for him; he met the same
fate. The next day the unhappy woman went to seek them, and there she
saw her husband and brother-in-law lying in one place with their heads
cut off; around was a pool of blood. The woman sat down, tore her hair,
and began to weep bitterly. At that moment there jumped out a little
mouse. It began to lick the blood, but the woman took a stone, threw it
at the mouse, and killed it. Then the mouse&rsquo;s mother came out and
said: &ldquo;Look at me, I can bring my child back to life, but what
canst thou do for thy husband and his brother?&rdquo; She pulled up an
herb, applied it to the little mouse, and it was restored to life. Then
they both disappeared in their hole. The woman rejoiced greatly when
she saw this; she also plucked of the same herb, put the heads on the
bodies, and applied it to them. Her husband and brother-in-law both
came back to life, but alas! she had put the wrong heads on the bodies.
Now, my sage youth! tell me, which was the woman&rsquo;s
husband?&rsquo; concluded the apple. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span></p>
<p>He opened his eyes, and said: &lsquo;Certainly it was he who had the
right head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The king was very glad.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A joiner, a tailor, and a priest were travelling together at
one time,&rsquo; began the apple. &lsquo;Night came on when they were
in a wood; they lighted a huge fire, had their supper, and then said:
&ldquo;Do not let us be deprived of employment, each of us shall in
turn watch, and do something in his trade.&rdquo; The joiner&rsquo;s
turn came first. He cut down a tree, and out of it he fashioned a man.
Then he lay down, and went to sleep, while the tailor mounted guard.
When he saw the wooden man, he took off his clothes and put them on it.
Last of all, the priest acted as sentinel. When he saw the man he said:
&ldquo;I will pray to God that He may give this man a soul.&rdquo; He
prayed, and his wish was granted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, my boy, canst thou tell me who made the man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He who gave him the soul.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The king was pleased, and said to himself: &lsquo;That is
two.&rsquo; The apple again went on: &lsquo;There were a diviner, a
physician, and a swift runner. The diviner said: &ldquo;There is a
certain prince who is ill with such and such a disease.&rdquo; The
physician said: &ldquo;I know a cure for it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I will run
with it,&rdquo; said the swift runner. The physician prepared the
medicine, and the man ran with it. Now tell me who cured the
king&rsquo;s son?&rsquo; said the apple.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He who made the medicine,&rsquo; replied the boy. When he had
given the three answers, the apple rolled back into the casket, and the
king put it in his pocket. The boy arose, embraced the king, and kissed
him: &lsquo;Many men have been here, but I have not been able to speak
before: now tell me what thou wishest, and I will do it.&rsquo; The
king asked that his viziers might be restored to life, and they all
went away with rich presents. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107"

<p class="first">There was, there was, there was, there was, and
nothing there was.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2605src" href=
"#xd21e2605" name="xd21e2605src">2</a> In a certain country, a certain
realm, a certain region, a certain village, there was an orphan so
poor, so poor, that &rsquo;tween heaven and earth nought could be found
that was his. Being in such a plight to-day, to-morrow, the day after
to-morrow, this week, next week, this month, next month, sad and
thoughtful he became; he thought, he thought, he thought, and at last
made up his mind: &lsquo;I will arise and try my luck,&rsquo; quoth he.
He rose betimes in the morning, called on the name of God, turned
himself to the right hand,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2611src" href=
"#xd21e2611" name="xd21e2611src">3</a> and set forth from the
house.</p>
<p>He went, he went, he went, beyond the sky, across the earth, across
the forest, across the field, across the plain, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>over
the mountains, he went as far as he could, and when he looked he saw a
man of graceful mien coming towards him. The youth quickened his step
and they met. &lsquo;I wish thee victory, good youth!&rsquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2618src" href="#xd21e2618" name="xd21e2618src">4</a>
said the stranger, &lsquo;whither goest thou?&rsquo; &lsquo;May God
send thee victory, my master,&rsquo; answered the young man, &lsquo;I
go to seek a livelihood.&rsquo; &lsquo;Be my servant for three years,
and I shall teach thee three things that will afterwards be
helpful,&rsquo; said this clever man to the youth. The youth agreed,
and went away with him.</p>
<p>At the end of a year&rsquo;s service, the clever man said to the
youth: &lsquo;Whatever thou seest outside thy yard, throw it into the
yard.&rsquo; When the second year had passed, he again spoke to the
youth, and said: &lsquo;Lend nothing to anybody unless thou art much
pressed to do so.&rsquo; The third year came to an end, and it was time
for the young man to depart; the clever man called him and said:
&lsquo;Tell not thy secret to a woman.&rsquo; Then he bade him
farewell, blessed him, and sent him home. The youth set out: he went,
he went, he went by day, he went by night, over land, over water, and
when he reached home he began to establish himself, he made a fence
round his yard and, as he had been instructed, threw into the yard all
he found outside the yard.</p>
<p>One morning he went out and found on the road a red snake; he
remembered the instruction of the clever man and threw the snake into
the yard. A week later, the young man noticed that on the place where
he had thrown the snake, it had laid a multitude of precious
stones.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2625src" href="#xd21e2625" name=
"xd21e2625src">5</a> It is no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111"
href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>wonder that the youth was
greatly pleased at this. He gathered up the snake and the precious
stones in the skirt of his garment, and put the snake in a nest in his
own house. Every day the snake laid him a precious stone. The youth
became wealthy: he built himself a fine house, took a wife, and lived
like a lord. Still the snake went on laying precious stones, the youth
became richer and richer, and gave himself up to gladness. One day his
wife said to him: &lsquo;Young man! who has made thee so fabulously
rich, for thou wast formerly poorer than any one on earth.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Who? God gave me wealth,&rsquo; said the husband, following the
clever man&rsquo;s advice, not revealing his secret. But the woman gave
him no peace; day and night she always asked the same thing: &lsquo;How
didst thou become wealthy?&mdash;thou must tell me, thou must.&rsquo;
The youth had no way of escape, she wearied him out, and at last made
him tell her all about the snake. Since there was nothing else to be
done, the young man took his wife and showed her the snake that laid
precious stones. After this, it happened that the snake ceased to lay
precious stones; the young man&rsquo;s wealth began to diminish, and
nothing was added to it.</p>
<p>When he was in this state, a certain man came and asked him for the
loan of a knife. Of course, being utterly cast down with grief and
sorrow, he remembered not the words the clever man had spoken to him,
and lent the knife. May it happen to thine enemy as it happened to him!
It happened that this wretched man was a thief. When he had got the
knife he went and broke into a house to steal; there he thrust the
knife into the belly of a sleeping man, slew him, and left the knife in
the dead man&rsquo;s body, then pillaged the house. Afterwards an
enquiry was made into the matter. They found the knife in the man who
had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>killed and robbed, and it turned out to be the
knife of the young man. Of course he was taken and bound, all his goods
were seized, and he was treated as a thief ought to be treated. Thus
did it happen to the wretched youth who disobeyed the instructions of
the clever man.</p>

<p class="first">There was once a king who had three sons and three
daughters. When the day of his death was come, he called all his
children, and said to his sons: &lsquo;Hearken to my will, and see that
ye fulfil it. When I die, let each of you watch my tomb for one week,
give these maidens to the suitors who ask for their hands.&rsquo; After
he had said farewell, the king died.</p>
<p>He was buried, and on the first night the eldest brother went to
guard the grave. But in a short time something <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>began to approach with a mighty noise, and when
it came near, it was so strong that it drove the prince out of the
enclosure. From a distance, the prince saw how the being that had come
with noise went to the king&rsquo;s grave, dug up the corpse, and wept
over it till morning; when morning came, it buried the corpse in the
earth again, and went away. When the prince reached home, he was
ashamed to say anything about what had happened.</p>
<p>At that time, both the elder brothers set out for the chase; the
youngest brother was left at home, he heard a voice and looked round.
It turned out to be a suitor for the hand of his sister. He took and
gave him the eldest sister. Soon after, he again heard a voice. The
prince looked round&mdash;another suitor had come. The absence of his
brothers somewhat disturbed him, but, according to his father&rsquo;s
will, he married his second sister also. A little later, a third voice
was heard, and to him he gave his third sister.</p>
<p>In the evening, when the two elder brothers came home, they did not
see their sisters; they asked the youngest, and he told them what had
happened. They were not pleased, and sent him out to feed the sheep.
That night the middle brother went to guard the king&rsquo;s grave; the
same thing happened to him as to his elder brother, but he too was
silent on the subject. When he reached home, the youngest brother began
to entreat his elder brothers, saying: &lsquo;Be just, let me also
watch my father&rsquo;s grave.&rsquo; But they were angry, and
answered: &lsquo;Get thee gone, how couldst thou guard the grave when
we are not able to do it!&rsquo; But afterwards they said one to the
other: &lsquo;Let us allow him to go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the youth went, came to the tomb of his father, lighted a candle,
and, as soon as he sat down, an uproar <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>began, but he was not
affrighted. At the approach of the monster an earthquake began, but the
youth was not afraid, he swung his sword round his head, and cleft the
monster in twain, but the monster&rsquo;s blood put out the candle.
Looking round, the youth saw, some way off, the blaze of a fire. He
arose and went thither. On his way he said to the cock: &lsquo;Crow
not, so that dawn break not till I come back again, or I shall slay
thee.&rsquo; When he came near, he met with a vast river like a sea.
When he had swum over and reached the other side, the youth saw that
the fire was burning among the <i>demis</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2692src" href="#xd21e2692" name="xd21e2692src">1</a> who were
sitting round it&mdash;so he stopped and bethought himself seriously;
but, at last, he took a leap, jumped into the middle of them, seized a
burning brand, and ran away.</p>
<p>The burning cinders and ashes were showered over the <i>demis</i>,
but they did not see the youth. The youth went back, but as he crossed
the river the burning log went out. He was angry at this, but what
could he do? He went back again, and when he threw himself upon the
fire the <i>demis</i> caught him, and asked what he wanted. He told
them. The <i>demis</i> said to him: &lsquo;In yonder castle there dwell
three maidens unseen by the sun,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2727src"
href="#xd21e2727" name="xd21e2727src">2</a> thou must bring them to us
or we will not let thee go.&rsquo; The youth asked <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>them: &lsquo;Is there a ladder up to the
castle?&rsquo; They answered: &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; &lsquo;Then let us
go,&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>He took all the <i>demis</i> with him, and said: &lsquo;I shall
climb up first, then you must come one by one.&rsquo; They agreed. The
youth went up, one <i>demi</i> came after him. As soon as the first
<i>demi</i> reached the top, the youth brandished his sword, slew him,
and laid down his body. When the second came up, he did likewise unto
him. Thus he slew them all, one by one, and left their bodies
there.</p>
<p>Then he went in, saluted the maidens, and gave each of them a
ring&mdash;to the youngest for himself, to the others for his brothers.
The youth went out, thrust his sword into a stone, and left it there,
took fire with him, and went back. When he had crossed the river, he
cried to the cock: &lsquo;Now crow!&rsquo; Then he went to his
father&rsquo;s grave. Till dawn he stayed there, and then he went
home.</p>
<p>The beautiful maidens told the king what had happened. The king
ordered all his subjects to be summoned, and asked: &lsquo;Who is able
to draw this sword out of the stone?&rsquo; But nobody could draw it
out. Then the king made a proclamation: &lsquo;To him that can draw out
this sword I will give my daughter.&rsquo; The princes, as soon as they
heard of this, decided to go thither. When they were making ready for
the journey, the youngest asked his brothers to take him too. At last
they consented to take him. When they arrived, they found a great
uproar: people from all parts of the world were, in turn, laying hold
of the sword, but could not draw it out. Last of all, the youngest
brother came up, pulled out his sword, put it in the scabbard, and said
to the king: &lsquo;All three daughters are ours now, for I have two
brothers.&rsquo; He called his brothers, and they took the three
maidens to wife. Great merry-making began. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span></p>
<p>The king gave to the wife of the youngest prince a flying carpet,
which carried away any one who sat on it. The princess sat on it, and
followed her suite. The groomsmen and youths set out with them. When
they had gone half way, a monster swooped down on the princess and
carried her off. A sad uproar began, but what was to be done? The young
prince said to his brothers: &lsquo;Farewell! I must perish with
her,&rsquo; and went away.</p>
<p>He went, he went, he went, he went as far as he could, and in a
field he found a spring, beside which he lay down. There came a boy
with a water jug. The prince asked: &lsquo;Whose village is
this?&rsquo; The boy replied: &lsquo;Here dwell three brother
<i>demis</i>, all married to daughters of one king.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the youth heard this he was glad, for it turned out that his
sisters dwelt here. When he came near, the sisters went out to meet
him. It is easy to imagine how glad they were to see him. When it was
dark, the three <i>demis</i> returned. One of the sisters went out to
meet them, and said: &lsquo;My brother is come.&rsquo; The <i>demis</i>
answered: &lsquo;If the elder brothers are come, we can make roast meat
of them, if it be the youngest, we shall know how to do him
honour.&rsquo; The <i>demis</i> went in, and kissed the youth for joy
at meeting him.</p>
<p>As they were all sitting round the hearth, the <i>demis</i> began to
sigh deeply. The youth asked them: &lsquo;Why do you sigh?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Why?&mdash;we are sorry for that poor damsel! Kazha-Ndii-Kerkun
(<i>i.e.</i> the swift, flint-like <i>demi</i>) was carrying through
the air a golden-haired woman; we pursued, but only succeeded in
pulling off a lock of the woman&rsquo;s hair.&rsquo; They showed the
hair to the youth. As soon as he saw it he fainted, crying: &lsquo;Ah!
woe is me! woe is me!&rsquo; The <i>demis</i> asked him what was wrong.
He told them all. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117"
name="pb117">117</a>]</span>As soon as day dawned, the youth arose, and
made ready to depart. The <i>demis</i> were very sorry at this, but
what could they do? They gave him a horse and a little dog.</p>
<p>The youth set out, and came to the house of Kazha-Ndii; but
Kazha-Ndii was not at home. He dismounted, and went in to the princess;
when they saw each other, their joy was so great that they fell to the
ground. The princess said to him: &lsquo;O youth, why hast thou sought
thy doom? Against Kazha-Ndii thou canst do nothing.&rsquo; But the
young man would not hearken, and lifted her on to his horse.</p>
<p>As soon as they reached the gate, it creaked so loudly that a star
fell from heaven. The door cried: &lsquo;Kazha-Ndii-Kerkun, where art
thou? they have carried off thy wife.&rsquo; Kazha-Ndii heard this, and
pursued them. When he was overtaking them, Kazha-Ndii&rsquo;s horse
neighed so loudly that it stopped the princess&rsquo;s horse. The
princess said to him: &lsquo;O youth, did I not tell thee how it would
be? Save thyself at least.&rsquo; Then Kazha-Ndii rode up, cut the
youth into pieces, and carried his wife back. The little dog came up,
gathered the scattered fragments of the young man&rsquo;s body, put
them in a bag, tied it to the saddle, mounted the horse, and took the
body to the <i>demis</i>.</p>
<p>When the <i>demis</i> saw it they wept greatly, but their youngest
brother blew the soul back into the pieces, and raised the youth to
life. The prince arose, and again made ready to depart; the youngest
<i>demi</i> said to him: &lsquo;Here is my three-legged horse,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2802src" href="#xd21e2802" name="xd21e2802src">3</a>
take him with thee; if he do not help thee there is no help to hope
for.&rsquo; The youth mounted the horse, came again to his princess,
took her and put her on the horse. When he was riding out of the gate
it creaked more loudly than before. Kazha-Ndii heard it and pursued
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>them. As he was overtaking them,
Kazha-Ndii&rsquo;s horse neighed, and the youth&rsquo;s horse slackened
its speed. The young prince said to his horse: &lsquo;Why doest thou
this?&rsquo; &lsquo;What can I do? If I had a fourth leg I might be
victorious.&rsquo; When Kazha-Ndii came near, the three-legged horse
neighed so loudly that it stopped Kazha-Ndii&rsquo;s horse. Then the
youth came up to him, brandished his sword, cut Kazha-Ndii into halves,
put the princess on his horse, and they rode merrily away. They visited
the <i>demis</i> and then went home.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Story of Geria, the Poor Man&rsquo;s Son</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a poor married man who had only one
son; but this son was very handsome and strong, and his name was
Geria.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2817src" href="#xd21e2817" name=
"xd21e2817src">1</a> Once the youth went out to hunt, and when he was
coming home in the evening he met a woman with a jar going to the
spring for water; he aimed an arrow at her, and broke the jar. The
woman turned to him and said: &lsquo;If thou art so warlike, instead of
breaking my pot why dost thou not go and fetch the only sister of the
twelve <i>demis</i> that dwell beyond the twelve mountains?&rsquo; When
he heard this, the youth&rsquo;s heart began to beat wildly for
eagerness to see the maiden.</p>
<p>He went home and said to his parents: &lsquo;Get ready food to last
me a year, and if I do not come back in that time set out to seek for
me.&rsquo; His parents would not consent, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>but said: &lsquo;We
have no child but thee, wilt thou go away from us and perish?&rsquo;
They wept with one accord, but Geria heeded them not. So they got him
provisions. They bade him farewell with sobs. Such wailing was there
that the parting was known throughout the country side, yea, even to
sun and moon, to heaven and earth, to the sea and the sands thereof. At
last they blessed their son and let him go. He took with him a little
dog, whose name was Mathicochi.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2830src"
href="#xd21e2830" name="xd21e2830src">2</a> When they took leave one of
another, they embraced, they kissed, and the youth sped on his way.</p>
<p>He went, he went, he went, he went as much as he could&mdash;week
and week, week and fortnight, a year and three months,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2835src" href="#xd21e2835" name=
"xd21e2835src">3</a>&mdash;he went over six mountains. When he had
crossed these six mountains everything round about him began to reel:
trees and stones fell down and clattered into the valleys, but Geria
was not hurt by them. Then, from beneath, there came to him a voice,
saying: &lsquo;What kind of man art thou to stand thus against me. Who
can resist me but Geria, the poor man&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis I&mdash;Geria, the poor man&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When she heard this, the Rokapi<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2840src"
href="#xd21e2840" name="xd21e2840src">4</a> went out to meet him, bowed
herself, did great honour to him, and said: &lsquo;Whither wilt thou
go?&rsquo; The youth told her all. The Rokapi was moved with sorrow.
Geria asked her: &lsquo;Why <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href=
"#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>dost thou
grieve?&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;For that I have seen many go thither, but I
have seen none come back.&rsquo; But Geria heeded her not, and went on
his way.</p>
<p>He went, he went, he went more than he could, and when he had
crossed the other six mountains a still greater earthquake began. It
turned out that this region belonged to the eldest sister of the
Rokapis; but Geria showed no sign of fear. The Rokapi cried to him:
&lsquo;What manner of man art thou to resist my witchcraft? Art thou
Geria, the poor man&rsquo;s son?&rsquo; He cried out to her: &lsquo;I
am he.&rsquo; The Rokapi at once went out to meet him, bowed herself,
treated him with respect, and asked him: &lsquo;Whither art thou
going?&rsquo; Geria told her his plan, and this Rokapi too was
distressed. Geria asked her why she grieved. She answered:
&lsquo;Because I have seen many on their way thither, but I have never
seen one come back; albeit, I will do thee one service, I give thee my
three-legged horse.&rsquo; She called the horse, and said to him:
&lsquo;As long as Geria lives serve him faithfully.&rsquo; Geria bade
her farewell, mounted the horse, and rode away with his little dog
Mathicochi.</p>
<p>He rode out into a great meadow, and came near the abode of the
<i>demis</i>. When he looked upon the mead his heart was glad, and his
eyes filled with tears, he bethought him of his home and its beautiful
fields, he uttered a blessing to God the merciful. Then he urged his
horse onward, at such speed that clouds of dust rose behind him. The
youth said to himself: &lsquo;Lo, I am now in the unknown land!&rsquo;
Up he rode to the <i>demis&rsquo;</i> gate, leaped from his horse, and
tied it there.</p>
<p>He walked away a little, and then cried: &lsquo;Methinks I have not
fastened my horse securely!&rsquo; Back he went, tore up an oak by the
roots, planted it with its branches downwards <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>in
the earth, and firmly tied his horse to it. Then the horse said:
&lsquo;If thou hadst not done this I should have fled home, but now do
as I tell thee, and all will be well. The <i>demis</i> are indoors; go
to the meadow, there thou wilt find a kettle, overturn it. Then betake
thyself to the damsel, and get her to plight her troth to
thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Geria went, kicked the kettle, turned it over three times, and left
it upside down, then he went to the maiden, broke all the locks, and
came to the room where she was. She was astonished, but the
youth&rsquo;s bravery pleased her, and, to make a long story short, she
promised to marry him. The youth went out merrily to the place where he
had left his horse. There he quietly spent the night, and next morning
the horse said: &lsquo;The <i>demis</i> have now gone out to the
meadow; when they saw the kettle turned over they marvelled, for it
usually takes all the twelve <i>demis</i> to turn over that kettle, and
they said one to another: &ldquo;Whatever we are commanded by him that
turned over the kettle that must we do,&rdquo;&mdash;now it is time for
thee to go thither.&rsquo; Geria went to the meadow.</p>
<p>As soon as the <i>demis</i> saw him, they all arose hastily, went to
meet him, bowed themselves, and said: &lsquo;What dost thou ask of
us?&rsquo; He answered: &lsquo;You must give me your sister to
wife.&rsquo; The <i>demis</i> said: &lsquo;We give her to thee, but the
Black King will not let thee take her.&rsquo; Geria answered: &lsquo;I
fear no man,&rsquo; so (not to lengthen unduly a long story) they made
ready a banquet.</p>
<p>While the feast was still going on, in the morning, Geria looked out
of the door, and saw a host of men in black apparel, who had been sent
by the Black King. Geria mounted his horse, dashed into the midst and
defeated them all; three only did he save alive, as messengers, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>sent them to say to the Black King:
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis I that have done this, Geria, the poor man&rsquo;s
son.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The King was very wroth, and sent almost all his army against him.
When Geria saw them, he bethought himself a little, but the horse said
to him: &lsquo;Youth! this is nothing, look for still worse.&rsquo;
Geria struck the horse with his whip, attacked the host, and slew all
but one; him he sent to bear the news. Upon this, the king went out of
himself with rage: he summoned his devoted and loyal slave to whom he
was wont to apply in all his difficulties, by name Qvamuritz
Khami;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2885src" href="#xd21e2885" name=
"xd21e2885src">5</a> to him he committed all that was left of the army,
and sent him out.</p>
<p>Geria arose and saw a sight, such a sight as I wish thine enemy may
see. It pleased him not to see Qvamuritz Khami; but what could be done?
The horse said to him: &lsquo;Youth! yonder is he of whom I
spake.&rsquo; Geria crossed himself, gave thanks to God, bade his wife
farewell, for he thought to die, and went out. First of all he slew the
army, and then he began a single combat with Qvamuritz Khami.</p>
<p>Mounted they fought with maces, but the battle was not to the
strong, for Qvamuritz Khami&rsquo;s soul was safe in other
hands&mdash;how could he be killed? Qvamuritz Khami cried: &lsquo;O
young man! thus shouldst thou shoot!&rsquo; and slew him. When Geria
was dead, the victor slaughtered all the <i>demis</i>, took
Geria&rsquo;s wife, put her on her husband&rsquo;s horse, and carried
her off to his master.</p>
<p>But she said to the king: &lsquo;I am the widow of such a man that I
will not belong to a man like thee; either do battle with me, and let
the conqueror have his will, or give me leave to wear mourning for
three months.&rsquo; The king feared to fight with her, for she was of
the <i>demi</i> race, so he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href=
"#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>gave her a respite of three
months. When Geria was killed, his head rolled one way and his body
another; his faithful dog Mathicochi went and put the two pieces
together, and lay down to guard them.</p>
<p>While all these things had been happening, a year had passed, and
when Geria&rsquo;s parents saw that he did not return, they set out to
seek him. When they came to a narrow road, they saw that several snakes
had met and were fighting, and all fell dead; then two great snakes
crawled out, threw themselves into the river, swam out again and began
to crawl over the dead snakes in various directions. They were all
restored to life. Geria&rsquo;s parents wondered at the sight, and said
one to the other: &lsquo;Let us take a little of this water.&rsquo;
They took a thimblefull of it.</p>
<p>When they approached, the little dog, Mathicochi, saw them, and ran
to meet them; sadly he took them to the dead body. When the unhappy
parents saw Geria dead, they both fell to the ground and sobbed
bitterly; then they remembered that the mother of the unfortunate youth
had the wonderful water with her. As soon as they sprinkled Geria with
it he came to life, and said: &lsquo;Woe is me! what a long time I have
slept!&rsquo; When he saw his parents, he was glad, but, remembering
all that had befallen him, he again grew sad, and bade his parents
farewell once more. They wept much, but, putting their trust in God,
armed themselves with patience.</p>
<p>Geria set out for the land of the Black King, and when he came near,
went into a great forest; as he entered, he heard a very great noise.
He stopped, and there, on the road, he saw some one coming along,
destroying all the forest as he went, tree fell on tree; he looked
steadily, and saw a great boar rushing straight towards him; he threw
himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name=
"pb124">124</a>]</span>on it, lifted it, and cast it three
shoulders&rsquo; lengths<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2912src" href=
"#xd21e2912" name="xd21e2912src">6</a> away from him; but they wrestled
again, they wrestled, they wrestled, three whole days they wrestled. At
last the youth was victorious, and tore the wild boar into halves. From
the lacerated boar there leaped out a wild goat. When the youth killed
the wild goat, there fell from it a little box; when he broke the box,
three swallows flew from it,&mdash;two of them he killed, the third he
caught and kept.</p>
<p>At that time Qvamuritz Khami fell ill, the agony of death came upon
him, for it turned out that this swallow was his soul. Geria killed the
swallow, and Qvamuritz Khami died.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2925src"
href="#xd21e2925" name="xd21e2925src">7</a></p>
<p>After this, Geria went into the king&rsquo;s palace, and slew all
therein excepting his wife. Her he took to his parents, whose patience
and grief were exchanged for great joy. They all went home
together.</p>

the surgeons agreed that there was a fish of a rare kind by the help of
which the king might be cured.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2937src"
href="#xd21e2937" name="xd21e2937src">1</a> They made a sketch of the
fish, and left it with the sick monarch. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb125" href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span></p>
<p>The king commanded his eldest son to go and catch that fish in the
sea. A hundred men with their nets were lost in the sea, but nought
could they find like the fish they sought. The eldest son came home to
his father and said: &lsquo;I have found nothing.&rsquo; This
displeased the king, but what could he do? Then the second son set out,
taking with him a hundred men also, but all his men were lost too, and
he brought back nothing.</p>
<p>After this, the youngest brother went. He had recourse to cunning;
he took with him a hundred kilas<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2945src"
href="#xd21e2945" name="xd21e2945src">2</a> of flour and one man. He
came to the sea, and every day he strewed flour in the water, near the
shore, until all the flour was used up; the fishes grew fat on the
flour, and said: &lsquo;Let us do a service to this youth since he has
enabled us to grow fat&rsquo;; so, as soon as the youth threw a net
into the sea, he at once drew out the rare fish he sought. He wrapped
it up in the skirt of his robe, and went his way.</p>
<p>As he rode along, some distance from his companion, he heard a voice
that said: &lsquo;O youth, I am dying!&rsquo; But on looking round he
saw no man, and continued his journey. After a short time, he again
heard the same words. He looked round more carefully, but saw nothing.
Then he glanced at the skirt of his robe, and saw that the fish had its
mouth open, and was dying. The youth said to it: &lsquo;What dost thou
want?&rsquo; The fish answered: &lsquo;It will be better for thee if
thou wilt let me go, some day I shall be of use to thee.&rsquo; The
youth took it and threw it into the water, saying to his comrade:
&lsquo;I hope thou wilt not betray me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When he reached home, he told his father that he had been
unsuccessful. Some time passed. Once the prince quarrelled with his
comrade, and the latter ran off and told <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>the king how his son
had deceived him. When the king heard this, he ordered his son to be
taken away and killed. He was taken out, but when they were about to
kill him, the youth entreated them, saying: &lsquo;What doth it profit
you if you slay me? If you let me go, &rsquo;twill be a good deed, and
I shall flee to foreign lands.&rsquo; The executioners took pity on
him, and set him free; he thanked them, and departed.</p>
<p>He went, he went, he went, he went farther than anybody ever
went&mdash;he came to a great forest. As he went through the forest, he
saw a deer running, in a great state of alarm. The youth stopped, and
fixed his gaze on it; then the deer came up and fell on its face before
him. The youth asked: &lsquo;What ails thee?&rsquo; &lsquo;The prince
pursues me, and on thee depends my safety.&rsquo; The youth took the
deer with him and went on. A huntsman met him, and asked:
&lsquo;Whither art thou leading the deer?&rsquo; The youth replied:
&lsquo;One king has sent it as a gift to another king, and, lo! I am
taking it.&rsquo; The youth thus saved the deer from death, and the
deer said: &lsquo;A time will come when I shall save thy
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youth went on his way: he went, he went, he went, so far he
went, good sir, that the &lsquo;three day colt&rsquo; (of fable) could
not go so far. He looked, and, lo! a frightened eagle perched on his
shoulder, and said: &lsquo;Youth, on thee depends my safety!&rsquo; The
youth protected it also from its pursuer. Then the eagle said to him:
&lsquo;Some day I shall do thee a service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youth went on: he went through the forest, he went, he went, he
went, he went farther than he could, he went a week, two weeks, a year
and three months. Then he heard some fearful rumbling, roaring, thunder
and lightning&mdash;something was coming through the forest, breaking
down <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>all the trees. A great jackal appeared, and ran
up to the youth, saying: &lsquo;If thou wilt thou canst protect me; the
prince is pursuing me with all his army.&rsquo; The youth saved the
jackal, as he had saved the other animals. Then the jackal said:
&lsquo;Some day I shall help thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youth went on his way, and, when he was out of the wood, came to
a town. In this town he found a castle of crystal, in the courtyard of
which he saw a great number of young men, some dying and some dead. He
asked the meaning of this, and was told: &lsquo;The king of this land
has a daughter, a maiden queen; she has made a proclamation that she
will wed him that can hide himself from her; but no man can hide
himself from her, and all these men has she slain, for he that cannot
hide himself from her is cast down from the top of the
castle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the youth heard this, he at once arose, and went to the maiden.
They bowed themselves each to the other. The maiden asked him:
&lsquo;Wherefore art thou come hither?&rsquo; The youth answered:
&lsquo;I come for that which others have come for.&rsquo; She
immediately called her viziers together, and they wrote out the usual
contract.</p>
<p>The youth went out from the castle, came to the seashore, sat down,
and was soon buried in thought. Just then, something made a great
splash in the sea, came and swallowed the youth, carried him into the
Red Sea, there they were hidden in the depths of the sea, near the
shore. The youth remained there all that night.</p>
<p>When the maiden arose next morning she brought her mirror and looked
in it, but she found nothing in the sky, she looked on the dry land,
and found nothing there, she looked at the sea&mdash;and then she saw
the youth in the belly of the fish, which was hiding in the deep
waters. After a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128"
name="pb128">128</a>]</span>short time, the fish threw up the youth on
the place where it had found him. He went merrily to the maiden. She
asked: &lsquo;Well, then, didst thou hide thyself?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, I
hid myself.&rsquo; But the maiden told him where he had been, and how
he got there, and added: &lsquo;This time I forgive thee, for the
cleverness thou hast shown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The youth set out again, and sat down in a field. Then something
fell upon him, and took him up into the air, lifted him up into the
sky, and covered him with its wing. When the maiden arose next morning,
she looked in her mirror, she gazed at the mountain, she gazed at the
earth, but she found nothing, she looked at the sky, and there she saw
how the eagle was covering the youth. The eagle carried the youth down,
and put him on the ground. He was joyful, thinking that the maiden
could not have seen him; but when he came to her she told him all.</p>
<p>Then he fell into deep melancholy, but the maiden, being struck with
wonder at his cunning in hiding himself, told him that she again
forgave him. He went out again, and, as he was walking in the field,
the deer came to him and said: &lsquo;Mount on my back.&rsquo; He
mounted, and the deer carried him away, away, away over all the
mountains that were there, and put him in a lair. When the maiden arose
next morning, she found him, and when he came back to her she said:
&lsquo;Young man, it seems that thou hast many friends, but thou canst
not hide thyself from me; yet this day also I forgive thee.&rsquo; The
youth went sadly away; he had lost confidence.</p>
<p>When he sat down in the field, an earthquake began, the town shook,
lightning flashed, thunder rolled, and when a thunderbolt had fallen,
there leapt out from it his friend <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129"
href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>the gigantic jackal, and said
to him: &lsquo;Fear not, O youth!&rsquo; The jackal had recourse to its
wonted cunning, it began to scrape at the earth: it dug, it dug, it
dug, and burrowed right up to the place where the maiden dwelt, and
then it said to the youth: &lsquo;Stay thou here, she will look at the
sky, the mountain, the sea, and when she cannot find thee she will
break her mirror; when thou hearest this, then strike thy head through
the ground and come out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This advice, of course, pleased the youth. When the maiden arose in
the morning, she looked at the sea, she found him not, she looked at
the mountain, she looked at the sky, and still she could not see him,
so she broke her mirror. Then the youth pushed his head through the
floor, bowed, and said to the maiden: &lsquo;Thou art mine and I am
thine!&rsquo; They summoned the viziers, sent the news to the king, and
a great feast began.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Cunning Old Man and the <i>Demi</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once an old man. He might have worked but he
was lazy. His children went out to the fields, but this old man sat by
the fire, and if they did not show him great respect, he kept them out
of the house. His daughters-in-law quarrelled with him, and ended by
turning him out of the house. He begged of his eldest daughter-in-law,
saying: &lsquo;Give me a jar of flour, an egg,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2994src" href="#xd21e2994" name="xd21e2994src">1</a> and an awl,
then I shall go away.&rsquo; She gave him these things.</p>
<p>The old man went on day and night, and came to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>bank
of a stream; he looked over, and saw on the other side a <i>demi</i>,
to whom he cried: &lsquo;Carry me across this river.&rsquo; The
<i>demi</i> answered: &lsquo;I shall not carry thee, but thou shalt
carry me across, or I shall turn thee into dust.&rsquo; The <i>demi</i>
seized a stone, struck it on the rocky bank, and turned the great stone
into powder. The old man also took his jar of flour, struck it on the
rock, and dust arose. The <i>demi</i> was astonished, and said:
&lsquo;How has he turned this stone into powder?&rsquo; The <i>demi</i>
took another stone, squeezed it in his hand, and said: &lsquo;I shall
crush thee like this stone.&rsquo; Then the old man took out the egg,
squeezed it, and when the moisture began to ooze out, the <i>demi</i>
was alarmed: he came over the stream, took the old man on his shoulder,
and carried him across.</p>
<p>In the middle of the stream, the <i>demi</i> said to the old man:
&lsquo;How light thou art!&rsquo; The old man answered: &lsquo;I am
holding on to the sky with one hand, if I let go, thou wouldst fall
under my weight.&rsquo; The <i>demi</i> said: &lsquo;Just leave go for
a moment.&rsquo; The old man took out the awl, and stuck it in the
<i>demi&rsquo;s</i> neck. The <i>demi</i> cried: &lsquo;Lay hold of the
sky again!&rsquo; The old man put the awl in his pocket.</p>
<p>When they had reached the other side, the <i>demi</i> said to the
old man: &lsquo;I shall drive in game, and thou canst meet it
here.&rsquo; So the <i>demi</i> went and drove in the game. The old man
was afraid of wild beasts, and hid himself in the forest, where he
found a dead red-breast.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3045src" href=
"#xd21e3045" name="xd21e3045src">2</a> When the <i>demi</i> returned,
he asked: &lsquo;What hast thou done with the game?&rsquo; The old man
replied: &lsquo;Thou didst not drive the game properly, or how could
any beast that walks on earth escape from me, that could catch this
bird on the wing?&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href=
"#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>demi</i> went and killed two deer, two wild goats, two boars,
two hares; some he boiled, some he roasted, he made ready two measures
(<i>kilas</i> of 36 to 40 pounds) of millet, two <i>cocas</i> (a
<i>coca</i>=25 bottles) of wine, and said: &lsquo;Let us sit down and
eat.&rsquo; The old man said: &lsquo;Make me a bridge over this river,
there will I sup.&rsquo; The <i>demi</i> built him a little bridge, on
which he seated himself. The <i>demi</i> gave him one deer, one wild
goat, one boar, one hare, one <i>kila</i> of millet, one <i>coca</i> of
wine, and then sat down near him in the field. The <i>demi</i> ate, but
the old man threw the food into the river. The <i>demi</i> thought the
old man was eating everything, and was afraid, thinking: &lsquo;It
would seem that he can eat more than I can.&rsquo; Lower down the
stream, wolves caught and ate the meat the old man threw away. The old
man asked for another deer. The <i>demi</i> brought it, and the old man
threw it in the water. The <i>demi</i> did not know this. The old man
said: &lsquo;I have had a snack this evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next day, the <i>demi</i> invited the old man to his house. They
went there. The <i>demi</i> went out alone to hunt. He met a wolf and a
jackal, and said to them: &lsquo;Come and hunt with me. To my house
there has come a guest who can eat ten deer and wild goats; yesterday
evening we had two deer, but they were a mere snack to him.&rsquo; The
wolf and the jackal said to the <i>demi</i>: &lsquo;Thy guest did not
eat one of them, he threw everything into the river, we caught it and
ate it, the old man ate nothing.&rsquo; The <i>demi</i> said to the
wolf and the jackal: &lsquo;Then let us go and expose this old
man&rsquo;s fraud.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There went with the <i>demi</i> nine wolves and jackals, to give
evidence against the old man. The old man looked out, and saw the
<i>demi</i> coming along in front, with the wolves <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>and
jackals behind him. The old man cried to the <i>demi</i>: &lsquo;Dost
thou not owe me more than ten wolves and jackals?&rsquo; The wolves and
jackals exchanged glances, and said: &lsquo;It would seem that this
<i>demi</i> has betrayed us.&rsquo; They threw themselves on the
<i>demi</i> and turned him into dust.<a class="noteref" id=

going to hide himself. The jackal told him to go home, and have no fear
of the old man, for it would choke him. The <i>demi</i> tied the jackal
to himself, with a stout rope, and went back. The old man met them with
the following words: &lsquo;This is splendid, my jackal&mdash;thou wast
to bring me nine <i>demis</i>, thou hast brought eight already, and
this will make the ninth.&rsquo; The <i>demi</i> was alarmed, he rushed
off, dragging after him the jackal, whom he knocked against twenty
trees, and disappeared. The old man stayed in the <i>demi&rsquo;s</i>
house all the days of his life.</p>

<h2 class="main">Sanartia</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a king who reached old age without
having a son. When he was very old, his wife at last bore him a son.
The child was called Sanartia (<i>i.e.</i> desired, longed for); he
grew up, and became very good and very clever, so that he understood
everything that took place among earthly beings, wherever they were;
but he did not obey his mother. She therefore hated him, and said to
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>king, her husband: &lsquo;Since this boy will
not obey his mother in anything, take him and throw him into the great
deep sea.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The king was much distressed, but he did as his wife asked. The
youth guessed what his parents were talking about, but he showed no
resistance. After this, his father said: &lsquo;Let us go and look at
the town.&rsquo; Then the youth said: &lsquo;Papa, give me a little
money.&rsquo; His father gave him money, and they went to see the town.
When they arrived, the boy bought a little axe, knives, needle, thread,
flint and tinder.</p>
<p>When they were on their way home, they came near the sea; the boy
pulled up an oak tree, and carried it on his shoulder. The father was
the first to see the sea, and when they were on the shore he said to
his son: &lsquo;Come hither, and see what a big fish I shall show
thee.&rsquo; When the son came up to look, his father cast him into the
great sea, together with the tree he carried. A fish swallowed the
youth; his father turned and went home.</p>
<p>In the sea, the youth kindled a fire in the fish&rsquo;s belly, cut
caviar out of it, roasted and ate it. On the caviar from this fish the
youth lived thirty years, in the belly of that fish. Then, his
firewood, flint and tinder being well-nigh exhausted, he made a very
big fire. When the fish felt the heat, it leaped up and fell on the dry
land. The youth said: &lsquo;I will cut open the fish&rsquo;s belly,
and see&mdash;if it is in the water, I shall sew it up again, if it is
ashore, I shall make a hole and get out.&rsquo; He cut a little, and
saw that it was on land. Then he cut a large opening, came out of the
fish, made a fire, cut flesh from the fish, roasted it, and ate it.</p>
<p>Just then, there passed a prince, on his way to marry a maiden, and
he saw the other prince coming out of the fish. The prince who was
going to seek his bride, sent a man to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb134" href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>the youth to ask him
to make way, for he was sitting in the road, and there was no other
road for horsemen. But Sanartia would not move. Then the prince himself
rode up, and asked: &lsquo;Who art thou?&rsquo; Sanartia told him the
name of the king, his father. Then the prince invited him, saying:
&lsquo;I go to marry a wife; ride with me.&rsquo; Sanartia agreed, and
they went together to the appointed place.</p>
<p>When they came near, they sent on a man to the king, who was master
of the country, asking him to give his daughter in marriage to the
prince. The king agreed, and sent to say: &lsquo;If the prince succeeds
in performing two exploits, I shall fulfil his wish; but to do these
deeds is both hard and perilous: the princess throws a great lump of
lead as far as a gun will carry a bullet, the suitor must throw it back
again to the place where the princess is standing.&rsquo; The suitor
for the maiden&rsquo;s hand sent and said: &lsquo;I will do
this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He went and stood in the place the maiden pointed out to him. She
threw a piece of lead which fell at the place where the prince stood;
he was not only unable to throw the lead, but could not even lift it
from the ground; then his comrade, the other prince, Sanartia, took up
the lead and threw it for him. The piece of lead went much farther than
the maiden had thrown it.</p>
<p>This exploit having been performed, the prince had another to do:
mistaking Sanartia for the suitor, they took him to a wilderness where
there was a castle, and in it dwelt Ocho-Kochi.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3185src" href="#xd21e3185" name="xd21e3185src">1</a> They opened
the door of the castle, and let <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135"
href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>in the prince, saying:
&lsquo;This Ocho-Kochi will kill the young man.&rsquo; He spent that
night in the castle.</p>
<p>When he was preparing to sleep, Ocho-Kochi came to him and wished to
kill him, but Sanartia was very strong, he seized Ocho-Kochi, threw him
on the ground, and beat him with all his might. When he had thrashed
him soundly, he said to him: &lsquo;Go and stand at the gate as
watchman.&rsquo; So he went and watched till dawn.</p>
<p>In the morning, the king, the maiden&rsquo;s father, sent his
vizier, saying: &lsquo;Find out what the prince and Ocho-Kochi are
doing.&rsquo; When the vizier came to the door, Ocho-Kochi called out
from the inside: &lsquo;Master sleeps, wake him not, or he will beat
me.&rsquo; The vizier made no reply to Ocho-Kochi, but went back and
told the king what he had heard.</p>
<p>The king was amazed, he set out for the castle, and said to
Ocho-Kochi: &lsquo;Open the door to me.&rsquo; But Ocho-Kochi replied:
&lsquo;Master will kill me.&rsquo; Just then, Sanartia awoke, and said
to Ocho-Kochi: &lsquo;Open the door for him.&rsquo; He immediately
opened the door, and let in the king. Then the king and Sanartia went
away together. The king wished to marry him to his daughter, but
Sanartia went away secretly; he dressed the prince, his companion, in
his clothes, and sent him in his place to the king; as soon as he
arrived he was wedded to the princess. Afterwards Sanartia visited him
as a friend.</p>
<p>If they had known that Sanartia had performed these exploits they
would not have given the princess to the other prince. But a handmaiden
at the court found out the secret somehow, that Sanartia had done the
deeds, and the princess&rsquo;s husband had done nothing. One evening
the handmaiden told the princess how Sanartia had cheated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>her
and married her to another man; she was angry, and that same night,
after Sanartia had lain down to sleep, she went and cut off his leg at
the knee.</p>
<p>Sanartia did not die of the wound, but went away to another land,
and became friendly with a one-handed man, and they lived together in
the house of the latter. Afterwards they built a house in common, and
moved into it. Sanartia took a maiden, and kept her with him as
nurse.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3203src" href="#xd21e3203" name=
"xd21e3203src">2</a> The two friends went out to hunt, and stayed in
the forest all night. At home there was nobody but the maiden.</p>
<p>Meantime there came a <i>demi</i>, who sucked the maiden&rsquo;s
breast and then went away. When Sanartia and his friend came home, the
girl told them what had happened. Sanartia left his friend and the girl
at home, and said to them: &lsquo;If the <i>demi</i> comes, take him
and keep him till I come back.&rsquo; The <i>demi</i> came, but the man
was afraid to lay hold of him; and the <i>demi</i> went away again. As
soon as Sanartia came in, he asked his friend and his nurse:
&lsquo;What did you do?&rsquo; They answered: &lsquo;The <i>demi</i>
came, but we could not take him, and he went away again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Next day Sanartia stayed at home, and sent his friend to hunt. The
<i>demi</i> came that night also, but as soon as Sanartia saw him he
met him at the door, and when the <i>demi</i> came in, Sanartia seized
him and threw him to the ground, then he told the nurse to bring a
rope, with which he bound him tightly. He took out his dagger, and was
about to cut him in pieces, but the <i>demi</i> entreated him,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>saying: &lsquo;Slay me not, and I will heal thee
of all infirmities.&rsquo; Sanartia hearkened to the
<i>demi&rsquo;s</i> prayers, and said: &lsquo;If thou wilt restore my
leg which was cut off I will let thee go, otherwise I slay
thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i>demi</i> pledged his word to heal him, and led him to a great
river, saying: &lsquo;Put thy leg therein and it will be sound.&rsquo;
But Sanartia did not yet believe the <i>demi</i>, so he ordered him to
bring a dry stick, and said: &lsquo;Put this stick in the water, and if
it becomes green and bears leaves then will I put in my leg, otherwise
I will not.&rsquo; The stick was put in the water, but it came out as
dry as before.</p>
<p>Then Sanartia was angry, and wished to kill the <i>demi</i>, but
again he entreated, saying: &lsquo;There is still another healing
stream.&rsquo; So he took him to the other stream, and as soon as
Sanartia put in his leg it was made whole and sound like the other leg.
After this, he did not kill the <i>demi</i>, but let him go free; he
made the <i>demi</i> heal his one-handed friend, whom he wedded to his
nurse. He left them there, and set out for his father&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p>But when he reached it, nobody knew him. Next day he secretly
mounted his father&rsquo;s horse, and went to the place where he had
married the prince to the princess. On the road he saw a swineherd;
when he approached, he recognised in him his old friend the prince.
When he questioned him, the swineherd replied: &lsquo;As soon as thou
hadst gone hence they made me a swineherd.&rsquo; Sanartia drew out his
sword, gave it to him, and said: &lsquo;Kill all the swine but three,
and wound those three; then drive the three home, I shall be there,
ready to punish anybody who is angry with thee.&rsquo; The swineherd
did as Sanartia told him, and in the evening drove the three swine into
the king&rsquo;s courtyard.</p>
<p>Sanartia came to the palace earlier, but they did not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>recognise him. When the swineherd drove in his
swine, his wife was about to beat him, saying: &lsquo;Why hast thou
lost the swine.&rsquo; But at that moment Sanartia appeared before the
princess, was angry with her, and said: &lsquo;If thou wert a good
woman thou wouldst not make thy husband feed swine.&rsquo;... They knew
at once that it was Sanartia, and were much amazed, saying: &lsquo;His
leg was cut off at the knee, how has he replaced his leg?&rsquo;
Sanartia ordered them to bring the princess&rsquo;s husband: he made
her wash him well with her own hands, bring clothes, and dress him in
noble apparel. When Sanartia was leaving for home, he called the
princess and her parents, and said to them: &lsquo;If you do not treat
the prince as becomes his rank, I shall come at once, and it will fare
ill with you.&rsquo; He took leave of them all and went home.</p>

<h2 class="label">VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Shepherd Judge</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In a certain land, there was once a king who had four
viziers to judge the people. Once these judges uttered a remarkable
sentence. At that time there came to the king a certain shepherd, who
spoke in a manner that pleased the king, so he commanded the viziers:
&lsquo;Show this shepherd the sentence you pronounced.&rsquo; When the
shepherd had examined the decree of the viziers, it did not please him;
he took it and altered it from beginning to end.</p>
<p>When the king saw this, he said to the shepherd: &lsquo;Since thou
art so skilled in judging, be thou a judge.&rsquo; The shepherd
refused, and said: &lsquo;As long as I have eyes I cannot <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>judge, if you put out both my eyes then I will
be a judge.&rsquo; Finally he persuaded them to put out his eyes. They
built him a great, fine house, they gave him scribes, furnished him
with everything befitting his office, and made the shepherd supreme
judge.</p>
<p>He began to do justice in such an upright manner that people flocked
to him from every side. Everybody went to him for justice: great and
small, master and servant, old and young, clergy and laity, friend and
enemy&mdash;in a word, all who had suits with anybody came to him,
every one praised and blessed his decisions.</p>
<p>Once there came to him a man and a woman. The man said to the judge:
&lsquo;I came to this woman&rsquo;s house on a mule; a calf accompanied
my mule. When I tied up the mule, the calf began to suck its breast.
The woman, seeing this, ran out, seized the calf, and began to grumble
at me, saying it was her calf, and asking how it came to be with my
mule. I withstood her with all my might, but it was of no avail. She
wished to drag away the calf, but I would not allow it, I would not
give up my property to her; we quarrelled, and now we have come before
thee&mdash;in God&rsquo;s name judge between us!&rsquo; Thus he spoke
in person to the judge, but secretly he sent him a large bribe and a
message, saying: &lsquo;Take this money, and put me not to shame before
this woman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the judge would not tamper with the scales of justice, and sent
to tell the man: &lsquo;How can I take the calf from the woman by
force, if justice do not demand it?&rsquo; The judge asked the woman:
&lsquo;What sayest thou?&rsquo; The woman replied: &lsquo;My lord, this
man rode up to my house on a mule; I had nothing in the world but one
calf and its mother, which I loved; my calf went up to this man&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>mule, caressed it, and took hold of it with its
snout, as if it were going to suck its breast. The man, seeing this,
thought: &lsquo;I shall certainly take away this calf with me.&rsquo;
He dragged it home, but, of course, I could not allow this&mdash;all
extol thine equity, I too am come to thy door, and trust thou wilt not
suffer me to be trampled down by injustice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>When the judge had heard both sides, he pronounced the following
decision: &lsquo;Since a mule never bore offspring and never will, it
is still less possible that a mule should bring forth a calf. Let the
calf therefore be taken from the man, and given to the woman who owns
the cow, the mother of the calf.&rsquo; This judgment pleased everybody
in the highest degree. And God was merciful to this good judge: by
means of the kerchief of that woman his eyes were made whole, and he
saw. After this he saw with both eyes, but till the day of his death he
judged uprightly; when he died he went to heaven.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Priest&rsquo;s youngest Son</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a priest who had three sons. On the day
of his death, the priest said to his sons: &lsquo;When I die, let each
of you read the psalter over me for one night.&rsquo; But the elder
sons did not do as their father had bidden them, only the youngest read
the psalter over him. That night his father appeared, and gave him a
horse. Next night he again read the psalter over his father in his
brothers&rsquo; place. His father again appeared, and gave him another
horse, which he resolved to give to his younger <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>brother. On the third night he again read the
psalter. His father brought him a third horse, gave the young man his
blessing, and departed.</p>
<p>At that time, a princess was to be married to any man whose horse
could jump up to the castle, so that its rider could kiss that
maiden-queen. Many princes came to woo, but none of their horses could
leap up to the castle. Then the priest&rsquo;s youngest son mounted the
horse his father had given him, and rode up to the royal palace; he
struck the horse with his switch, and made it jump, but it could only
go one third of the way up to the castle. Next day he mounted another
horse, and made it jump, it went two thirds of the height of the
castle. The third day he came on the third horse, and made it jump; it
jumped right up to the top of the castle; the youth kissed the
princess, and they married him to her. After this the priest&rsquo;s
son went home.</p>
<p>At this time the queen, his mother-in-law, fell ill; she sent for
her son-in-law, and said to him: &lsquo;Between the white sea and the
black sea there feeds a doe, they tell me that its milk will do me
good; if thou canst get it for me I shall recover, if not, I must
die.&rsquo; Then the youth mounted his horse and went forth. He rode
between the seas, milked the doe, brought its milk to his
mother-in-law, gave it to her to drink, and healed her. <span class=

<h2 class="main">The Strong Man and the Dwarf</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There came from far-off lands a strong man who had
nowhere met his match, and challenged any one in the whole kingdom to
wrestle with him. The king gathered his folk together, but, to his
wonder, could not for a long time find anybody ready to face the strong
man, till, at last, there stood forth a weak insignificant-looking
dwarf, who offered to wrestle with the giant.</p>
<p>Haughtily looking down on his adversary, the giant carelessly turned
away, thinking that he was befooled. But the dwarf asked that his
strength should be put to the proof before the struggle began.</p>
<p>The giant angrily seized a stone, and, clasping it in his fingers,
squeezed moisture out of it.</p>
<p>The dwarf cunningly replaced the stone by a sponge of the same
appearance, and squeezed still more moisture out of it.</p>
<p>The giant then took another stone, and threw it so violently on the
ground that it became dust.</p>
<p>The dwarf took a stone, hid it under the ground, and threw on the
ground a handful of flour, to the great astonishment of the giant.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>Stretching forth his hand to the dwarf, the giant said: &lsquo;I
never expected to find so much strength in such a small man, I will not
wrestle with you; but give me your hand in token of friendship and
brotherhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this, the giant asked the dwarf to go home with him. But first
he asked the dwarf why he had not pressed his hand in a brotherly
manner. The dwarf replied that he was unable to moderate the force of
his pressure, and that more than one man had already died from the
fearful force of his hand. The new brothers then set out together. On
their way to the giant&rsquo;s house, they came to a stream which had
to be forded.</p>
<p>The dwarf, fearing to be carried away by the current, told the
strong man that he was suffering from belly-ache, and did not therefore
wish to go into the cold water, so he asked to be carried over.</p>
<p>In the midst of the stream, the strong man, with the dwarf on his
shoulders, suddenly stopped and said: &lsquo;I have heard that strong
people are heavy, but I do not feel you on my shoulders. Tell me how
this is, for God&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Since we have become brothers,&rsquo; replied the dwarf,
&lsquo;I have no right to press with all my weight upon you, and did I
not support myself by holding on to the sky with one hand, you could
never carry me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the strong man, wishing to test his strength, asked the dwarf to
drop his hand for a moment, whereupon the dwarf took from his pocket
two nails, and stuck the sharp points of them in the shoulders of the
strong man.</p>
<p>The giant could not endure the pain, and begged the dwarf to lighten
his burden at once, <i>i.e.</i> to lay hold of heaven with one hand
again.</p>
<p>When they had reached the other side, the two new <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=
"pb149">149</a>]</span>friends soon came to the strong man&rsquo;s
house. The giant, wishing to give a dinner to the dwarf, proposed that
they should share the work of getting it ready, that one of them should
take the bread out of the oven, while the other went to the cellar for
wine.</p>
<p>The dwarf saw in the oven an immense loaf which he could never have
lifted, so he chose to go to the cellar for wine. But when he had
descended, he was unable even to lift the weights on the top of the
jars, so, thinking that by this time the giant would have taken the
loaf out of the oven, he cried: &lsquo;Shall I bring up all the
jars?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The giant, alarmed lest the dwarf should spoil his whole
year&rsquo;s stock of wine, by digging the jars out of the ground,
where they were buried, rushed down into the cellar, and the dwarf went
upstairs.</p>
<p>But great was the astonishment of the dwarf when he found that the
bread was still in the oven, and that he must take it out, willy-nilly.
He succeeded with difficulty in dragging a loaf to the edge of the
oven, but then he fell with the hot bread on top of him, and, being
unable to free himself, was almost smothered.</p>
<p>Just then the giant came in, and asked what had happened. The dwarf
replied: &lsquo;As I told you this morning, I am suffering from a
stomach-ache, and, in order to soothe the pain, I applied the hot loaf
as a plaster.&rsquo; ... Then the giant came up, and said: &lsquo;Poor
fellow! How do you feel now, after your plaster?&rsquo; &lsquo;Better,
thank God,&rsquo; replied the dwarf, &lsquo;I feel so much better that
you can take off the loaf.&rsquo; ... The giant lifted the loaf, and
the two then sat down to dinner. Suddenly the giant sneezed so hard
that the dwarf was blown up to the roof, and seized a beam, so that he
should not fall down again. The giant looked up with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>astonishment, and asked: &lsquo;What does this
mean?&rsquo; The dwarf angrily replied: &lsquo;If you do such a vulgar
thing again I shall pull this beam out and break it over your stupid
head.&rsquo; The giant made humble excuses, and promised that he would
never sneeze again during dinner time; he then brought a ladder by
which the dwarf came down....<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3473src" href=

<p class="first">The grasshopper and the ant became friends, and
entered into a compact of brotherhood, promising never to separate.
They then set out on a journey, forgetful of the proverb that
&lsquo;footman and horseman can never be comrades.&rsquo; Of the truth
of this they had a proof on the very first day of their travels, for,
chancing to come to a brook which they had to ford, the grasshopper
jumped over, while the poor ant was carried away by the stream.</p>
<p>The grasshopper thought, for a moment, how he could save his
drowning companion, and then cried: &lsquo;Catch hold of something, and
I shall run and get help.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The bright idea struck him of applying to the sow for one of her
bristles, to which the ant could attach herself while he pulled her out
of the water.</p>
<p>The sow answered: &lsquo;Brother grasshopper, you know the proverb,
&ldquo;hand washes hand&rdquo;; for three days I have eaten nothing,
and am I to let people pull bristles out of me for nothing? Feed me
with acorns, and then you can have as many bristles as you like.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=

<p>The grasshopper hurried off to the oak and said: &lsquo;Oak, oak,
give me acorns, I give the acorns to the sow, the sow gives me a
bristle, and with the bristle I save my drowning comrade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The oak answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Those thievish jays give me no rest, they pull off my acorns;
keep them off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grasshopper ran to the jays, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Jays! leave the oak, and the oak will give me acorns, the
acorns I give to the sow, the sow gives me a bristle, and with the
bristle I save my drowning comrade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The jays answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The kites pursue us; go and drive them off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grasshopper ran to the kites, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kites! leave the jays, and the jays will leave the oak, the
oak will give me acorns, the acorns I give to the sow, the sow gives me
a bristle, and with the bristle I save my drowning comrade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The kites answered:</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are hungry; bring us chickens.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grasshopper ran to the hen, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hen, give me chickens. The chickens I shall give to the
kites, the kites leave the jays, the jays leave the oak, the oak gives
acorns, the acorns I give to the sow, the sow gives me a bristle, with
the bristle I save my drowning comrade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hen replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Feed me with millet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grasshopper hastened to the barn:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Barn, give me millet, the millet I give to the hen, the hen
gives me chickens, the chickens I give to the kites, the kites leave
the jays, the jays leave the oak, the oak gives acorns, the acorns I

save my drowning comrade.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152"

<p>The barn replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The rats have the mastery over me, they gnaw me on every
side; send them away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grasshopper ran to the rats:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Rats! go away from the barn, and the barn will give me
millet, the millet I give to the hen, the hen gives me chickens, the
chickens I give to the kites, the kites leave the jays, the jays leave
the oak, the oak gives acorns, the acorns I give to the sow, the sow
gives me a bristle, and with the bristle I save my drowning
friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rats replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;The cats give us no peace; send them away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grasshopper went to the cats:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cats! go away from the rats, and the rats will leave the
barn, the barn will give millet, the millet I give to the hen, the hen
gives me chickens, the chickens I give to the kites, the kites leave

give to the sow, the sow gives me a bristle, and with this bristle I
shall save my drowning comrade.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The cats replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Feed us with milk.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grasshopper ran to the cow:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cow! give me milk, the milk I shall give to the cats, the
cats will leave the rats alone, the rats will leave the barn,&rsquo;
etc., etc.</p>
<p>The cow replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Feed me with grass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The grasshopper applied to the earth, and said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;O earth! give me grass, the grass I shall give to the cow,
the cow will give me milk, the milk I shall give to the cats, then the

and the jays will leave the oak, the oak will give me acorns, the
acorns I shall give to the sow, the sow will give me a bristle, and
with this bristle I shall save my drowning friend.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The earth gave the grass ... and finally the grasshopper obtained
the bristle, and hastened with it to his drowning friend, but, to his
astonishment, the ant was quite dead when he pulled him out. This story
teaches that help is only valuable when it is given in time, that the
earth alone refuses not to yield her gifts to him that asks, and that
all other things exist only by reciprocal services.</p>

<h2 class="main">The Countryman and the Merchant</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A countryman caught a pheasant, and was carrying it
home to cook it for himself and his wife.</p>
<p>Suddenly the pheasant spoke like a man, and said: &lsquo;Let me go,
goodman, and I shall repay you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The countryman was astonished, and asked:</p>
<p>&lsquo;What could you do for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The pheasant replied: &lsquo;You are an old man, and must soon die;
when you are dead, I shall gather together all the birds of the air,
and follow you to the grave. Since the world began, no king ever had
such an honour paid to him at his funeral.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The countryman was pleased at the offer, and set the pheasant free.
When he reached home, he told his wife what had happened, and, although
she scolded him at first for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href=
"#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>letting the bird go, yet she was
pleased when the pheasant sent, every morning, birds to ask after the
old man&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>A happy thought soon occurred to the wife, and she said to her
husband: &lsquo;Listen to me, we are almost dying of hunger, and we
have a good chance of getting plenty of food. Pretend that you are
dead; I shall begin to cry, and all the birds will come to your
funeral, I shall entice them into our cottage, shut the doors and
windows; we can knock them down with sticks, and thus lay in a store of
food to last us for a long time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So the countryman covered himself with a sheet, and lay down, while
his wife went outside and wept loudly.</p>
<p>A hoopoe flew down, and asked after her husband&rsquo;s health; when
the wife announced his death, the hoopoe at once flew away, and, within
an hour, there flew into the yard, in long lines, some thousands of
pheasants, the same number of doves, snipe, quails, woodcock, etc., and
even eagles, kites, hawks, etc.</p>
<p>Some of the birds settled in the cottage, some in the barn, some in
the stable, some in the yard, and the rest, for which there was no
room, remained in serried ranks in the air.</p>
<p>Then the wife shut the doors, and, with her husband, set about
killing the birds; only those that were outside escaped.</p>
<p>In the evening, there came a merchant, and asked to be allowed to
spend the night in the cottage. At supper, the merchant saw a great
abundance of game of all kinds, and asked the countryman how such
luxury was within the reach of a poor man. The countryman replied:
&lsquo;I have a cat of a famous breed, which has never yet failed me.
When I want game for my table, I tell her what kind of birds I should
like, and how many, and she goes into the forest and gets them. I do
not know what was the matter with her <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>last night, but see!
she went into the wood of her own will, and killed all the birds in the
neighbourhood, and brought them to us.&rsquo; The countryman then
showed a whole heap of dead game.</p>
<p>The merchant at once began to bargain with the countryman for the
cat, and finally purchased it for a large sum.</p>
<p>When the merchant reached home, he went about his business, and told
his wife that he would not leave her any money for housekeeping, for
she had only to give her orders, and the cat would bring all sorts of
game for food. But when he came in, he was astonished to find that his
wife had eaten nothing, the cat had brought no birds, but had even
stolen what was in the house already. So he went back to ask the
countryman about it.</p>
<p>The countryman saw him coming, filled a pot with millet and hung it
over the fire. He then sat down near it, put a grain of millet in the
palm of his hand, and began to wash it. The merchant came in and stood
by him; the countryman pretended not to see the merchant, muttered an
incantation, and dropped the grain into the pot. Then he stirred it
with a spoon, and behold the pot was full. The merchant did not know
whether to quarrel with the countryman or to get this magic pot from
him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is this you have done to me?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Your
cat is useless, it brings nothing, and steals what we have.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Have you been feeding it with roast meat? I forgot to warn
you that you must not do this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it is my fault then,&rsquo; said the merchant.
&lsquo;But will you sell me that pot?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have already lost my famous cat. It is not likely that I
shall now let you have this pot, in which I can make a dish of porridge
with only one grain.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href=
"#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p>However, they began bargaining, and at last the countryman sold his
pot for a large sum. When the merchant reached home, he consoled his
wife by telling her that from one barleycorn she could now make as much
porridge as she wanted; he then set out again. When he returned, his
wife complained that the pot was of no use. So he called again on the
countryman, to ask for an explanation.</p>
<p>The countryman, foreseeing that the merchant would come, got two
hares exactly alike, and tied ribbons of the same colour round their
necks. He left one hare at home, and took the other out into the fields
with him. He told his wife that if the merchant came, she was to send
him out to the field, and in an hour bring him a dinner consisting of
two boiled fowls, a roast turkey, ten eggs, wine, and bread.</p>
<p>The merchant came, and the woman sent him to the field where her
husband was working. In reply to the reproaches of the merchant, the
countryman said: &lsquo;You have probably made some stupid mistake with
the pot as you did with the cat. But let us sit down and dine while we
talk it over, for I cannot suffer you to come to me without feeding
you.&rsquo; The merchant looked round and said: &lsquo;How can we get
anything to eat out here in the fields?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The peasant went to a bush, untied the hare, and said to it:
&lsquo;Run at once, little hare, to my wife, and tell her to come with
you and bring us a pair of fowls, a roast turkey, ten eggs, wine, and
bread.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hare ran off as fast as it could. It is easy to understand the
astonishment of the merchant when the woman came with the hare,
bringing all that the man had ordered. When they had eaten, the
merchant said: &lsquo;You have cheated me about the cat and the pot,
but I forgive you if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157"
name="pb157">157</a>]</span>you let me have the hare.&rsquo; The
countryman refused at first, but finally agreed to sell the hare for a
large sum.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3637src" href="#xd21e3637" name=
"xd21e3637src">1</a></p>
<p>On his way home with the hare, the merchant met some friends whom he
asked to sup with him, but seeing that he would not arrive until it was
late, he ordered the hare to run and tell his wife that he was coming
with some guests, and that she was to prepare supper. When he and his
friends reached home, they found the house quite dark, and had
difficulty in rousing the wife from her sleep. She told him that no
hare had been there, and that she did not know what he was talking
about.</p>
<p>The merchant was now furious, and determined to punish the
countryman severely. But the countryman guessed what would happen, and
arranged with his wife what should be done. He took the intestine of a
small calf, filled it with blood, and tied it round his wife&rsquo;s
neck, telling her to cover it up with a kerchief. The merchant came in,
and without saying a word rushed at the countryman, who, in his turn,
attacked his wife, accusing her of being the guilty party, and with a
knife pierced the intestine under her throat. She fell on the ground,
and pretended that she was dying. The merchant was alarmed, and cried:
&lsquo;What have you done, you wretched man? I would willingly have
lost the money rather than have this innocent blood shed.&rsquo; The
countryman answered: &lsquo;That is my affair. Though I have killed my
wife I can raise her to life again.&rsquo; &lsquo;I believe you no
longer,&rsquo; said the merchant, &lsquo;but if you perform this
miracle I shall forgive you all.&rsquo; The countryman approached his
wife with the knife in his hand, muttered something, and his wife
opened her eyes, and, to the surprise of the merchant, rose up.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span></p>
<p>The merchant bought the wonderful knife, saying that his wife, too,
needed a lesson sometimes. When the merchant reached home, his wife
asked where he had been. He told her to be silent and mind her own
business. &lsquo;If you are not quiet I will cut your throat.&rsquo;
The woman looked at him with astonishment, and wondered whether he had
gone out of his mind. The merchant threw down his wife, and cut her
throat. All the neighbours flocked in, and raised a great cry. The
merchant said: &lsquo;What if I have killed my wife? I can bring her to
life again.&rsquo; The neighbours stood by while he muttered the
invocations he had learnt, but he could not raise her. Then he flew to
the countryman, tied his hands, and dragged him into the forest,
saying: &lsquo;I wish to prolong your sufferings, and will not kill you
at once. I shall starve you, drag you about in the woods, and, when I
have worn you out with tortures, I shall throw you into the sea.&rsquo;
On the road there was a town, in which a king had just died, and his
funeral was then taking place. Having bound the countryman to a tree in
the depths of the forest, the merchant returned to the town to see the
royal funeral. Just then, a shepherd happened to drive his flock near
the tree to which the countryman was tied. Seeing the shepherd a little
way off, the countryman began to shout: &lsquo;I will not be king! I
will not be king! No! No! No!&rsquo; The shepherd came up and asked
what was wrong. The countryman replied: &lsquo;You know, brother, that
the king is dead in the town: they want me to take his place, but I
will not, for I have been king twice, and know what it is. Ah, brother!
one has so many cares, so much work, that one&rsquo;s head swims. I had
rather be tied to this tree than consent to be king.&rsquo; The
shepherd thought for a moment, and replied: &lsquo;I, brother, would
give anything in the world to have a trial of the life of a
king.&rsquo; &lsquo;I gladly give you my place, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>but,
so that people may not know, put on my clothes, and I shall bind you to
the tree, and by to-morrow you shall be king.&rsquo; The shepherd
gladly gave him his flock, and took his place at the tree.</p>
<p>As soon as the countryman was free, he drove away the flock.</p>
<p>When it was quite dark, the merchant appeared, loosed his victim,
and drove him on. When they came to the steep seashore, the shepherd
saw that the merchant wished to drown him, and cried: &lsquo;Do not
drown me! I had rather consent to be king.&rsquo; The merchant thought
his prisoner had lost his wits through fatigue and ill-treatment;
without more ado he threw him into the sea.</p>
<p>A fortnight later, the merchant was travelling on business, when he
met on the road the same countryman whom he, as he thought, had
drowned, and who was now driving a flock. &lsquo;What do I see!&rsquo;
cried the merchant. &lsquo;Are you there? Did I not drown you in the
sea?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My benefactor!&rsquo; replied the countryman. &lsquo;I wish
you would drown me again. You cannot imagine what a quantity of cattle
there is down there at the bottom of the sea. It is a pity I had no
stick with me, for I could not drive out more than these with my
hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The merchant besought the countryman, saying: &lsquo;You have ruined
me. The cat, the pot, the hare, the knife, have all cost money; thanks
to you, I am a beggar and a widower. If you remember the place where I
threw you into the sea, drown me there, but let me have a stick, so
that I may repair my fortune.&rsquo; To get rid of the troublesome
merchant, the countryman agreed to fulfil his request, and so drowned
him with a very long switch in his hand.<a class="noteref" id=

<h2 class="main">The King and the Sage</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Once upon a time, there reigned in one of the realms
of the East a shah named Ali, a man of amiable and merry character. Ali
was much beloved by his subjects, and he too loved them with all his
heart. The shah played with them as if they had been his children; he
gave them festivals, arranged competitions, and gave prizes for the
best poetical productions, etc. The shah was skilled in the famous
literature of Arabia, and was thought to be a learned man; besides
this, he was a wit and a joker, and loved to set his folk merry riddles
to guess: prizes were given to the successful. Once the <i>ferashes</i>
(or servants) of the shah made known to the people, that Ali had
promised three hundred pieces of gold to him who should ask his majesty
such a question that the answer must inevitably be: <i>That is
Impossible</i>.</p>
<p>This announcement created great excitement, and men, women, and
children all alike set themselves to think out such a question. The day
of the competition dawned at last, and the vast square before the
palace was crowded with a curious throng. At the appointed hour, Shah
Ali appeared, surrounded by a brilliant guard, and music filled the
air. After greeting his folk, the shah sat down on a throne, opposite
the platform on which the candidates were to stand while they asked the
shah their questions. Heralds gave out the challenge, and a wit of the
town mounted the rostrum and loudly said: &lsquo;Shah! a courier has
just galloped into the town and told me a most astonishing piece of
news, to wit, that at dawn this morning, twenty versts from your
capital, the moon fell from the sky <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>to the ground, and
burned two and twenty villages to ashes.&rsquo; The shah meditated a
moment, and then replied: &lsquo;That is possible.&rsquo; The town wit
got down, amid the laughter of the people.</p>
<p>His place was taken by a courtier, the shah&rsquo;s body-surgeon,
who shouted: &lsquo;Most illustrious Shah! In your harem a most
astounding event has just happened&mdash;your first wife, your beloved
Zuleika, has just given birth to a sucking-pig covered with
bristles.&rsquo; The shah considered, and then replied: &lsquo;That is
possible.&rsquo; The doctor fled in shame, and the people laughed more
loudly than before.</p>
<p>After the doctor came an astrologer, who said: &lsquo;Most noble
Shah! In observing the courses of the stars I have discovered a woful
piece of news; an awful fate awaits you. O King, you will soon have
horns like a goat, and claws like a panther, you will lose the power of
speech, and flee from us into the woods, where you will dwell exactly
seven years and three months.&rsquo; To him likewise the shah replied:
&lsquo;That is possible,&rsquo; and he too disappeared, amid the jeers
of the mob.</p>
<p>The competition lasted throughout the whole of that day and the
next, to the delight of the people, until at last they thought of
getting a certain Nasr-Eddin, a wit well known throughout the East, to
oppose to the shah.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3693src" href=
"#xd21e3693" name="xd21e3693src">1</a></p>
<p>On the third, and last, day appeared Nasr-Eddin, tattered and almost
naked, dragging with him two great clay jars. Addressing the shah, he
said: &lsquo;Hail to the commander of the faithful, blessed be thy
name! Thou shalt reign yet a hundred years, and the love and confidence
of thy subjects <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162"
name="pb162">162</a>]</span>will increase yearly.&rsquo; &lsquo;That is
possible,&rsquo; said the shah. &lsquo;That the confidence your
subjects repose in you is unbounded is evident from a fact which I am
about to relate; you will doubtless deign to listen.&rsquo; &lsquo;That
is possible.&rsquo; &lsquo;Your late father (God rest his soul!) was
very friendly with my late father (may the Prophet give him a place in
Paradise!)...&rsquo; &lsquo;That is possible.&rsquo; &lsquo;Listen to
me, O Shah! When your father went forth to war with the unbelievers, he
was so poor that he could not raise an army.&rsquo; ... &lsquo;That is
possible.&rsquo; &lsquo;Not only is it possible but true, for, owing to
his want of money, he borrowed from my father these two jars full of
gold pieces, and promised on his royal word that you, O Shah, would pay
your father&rsquo;s debt to me.&rsquo; Shah Ali burst into laughter,
and said: &lsquo;That is impossible! Your father was a tatterdemalion
like yourself, and never saw two jars of gold even in his dreams. Take
your three hundred gold pieces, and the devil take you. You rascal, you
have outwitted me.&rsquo;</p>

child in a common cradle, and her own son in the gorgeous royal cradle.
Some years afterwards, the king took the changeling to court, and
brought his foster-brother with him. One fine day, the king set out for
his favourite forest to hunt, and took his pretended son with him. When
they arrived, the king asked: &lsquo;How do you like this place, my
son? Is it not a magnificent wood?&rsquo; The boy replied: &lsquo;O
father, if we could only burn it all somehow, what a fine lot of
charcoal we should have!&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163"

<p>Then the king sent for the other boy, and asked him the same
question. &lsquo;There could not be a better forest, your
Majesty!&rsquo; &lsquo;But what would you do with it if it were
yours?&rsquo; &lsquo;Nothing, your Majesty. I would double the guards,
so that it should not be injured.&rsquo; Then the king saw how the
smith&rsquo;s wife had tried to cheat him, and put her in prison.</p>

<p class="first">Shah Ali desired to see the hungriest man in his
kingdom, and find out how much of the daintiest food such a man could
eat at a meal. So he let it be known that on a certain day he would
dine with his courtiers in the open air, in front of the palace. At the
appointed hour, tables were laid and dinner was served, in the presence
of a vast crowd. After the first course, the shah mounted a da&iuml;s,
and said: &lsquo;My loyal subjects! you see what a splendid dinner I
have. I should like to share it with those among you who are really
hungry, and have not eaten for a long time, so tell me truly which is
the hungriest of you all, and bid him come forward.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Two men appeared from the crowd: an old man of fifty and a young man
of twenty-seven. The former was grey-haired and feeble, the latter was
fresh and of athletic build.</p>
<p>&lsquo;How is it that you are hungry?&rsquo; asked the shah of the
old man. &lsquo;I am old, my children are dead, toil has worn me out,
and I have eaten nothing for three days.&rsquo; &lsquo;And you?&rsquo;
said the shah, turning to the young man. &lsquo;I could not find work,
and as I am a hearty young man I am ashamed to beg, so I too have not
eaten for three days.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href=

food, on one plate, and in small portions. The hungry men eagerly ate,
watching each other intently. Suddenly the old man and the young one
both stopped and began to weep. &lsquo;Why do you weep?&rsquo; asked
the shah in astonishment. &lsquo;I have no teeth,&rsquo; said the old
man, &lsquo;and while I am mumbling my food this young man eats up
everything.&rsquo; &lsquo;And why are you weeping?&rsquo; &lsquo;He is

the building was begun. Bones of all kinds were brought and cleaned,
and the walls were rising, but they could not find a hedge-sparrow,
and, as the queen wanted all sorts of birds, a search was made for the
missing one. At last the hedge-sparrow was found, and brought before
the king, who asked where she had been. &lsquo;Mighty monarch! I have
been flying all over the kingdom counting the men and women;
unfortunately there are twice as many women as men.&rsquo; The king
ordered the bird to be punished for telling him such a shameless
falsehood. &lsquo;King of kings,&rsquo; said the hedge-sparrow,
&lsquo;perhaps I did not count in the same way as you do.&rsquo;
&lsquo;How did you count, then?&rsquo; &lsquo;I counted all those men
who are under the slipper of women as old women.&rsquo; The

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A certain man died and left three sons. One was
altogether a fool, another was fairly intelligent, and the third was
rather clever. This being so, it was of course difficult for them to
live together. In dividing the inheritance among them, the fool was
cheated, and in regard to the cattle he was thus cozened: There were
three entrances to the penfold, two open and one very narrow. The two
clever brothers proposed to drive the beasts out of all three at once;
those that issued from the small gap were to belong to the fool. In
this way the latter&rsquo;s share was only one young bull out of the
whole flock. But to his feeble mind the division seemed fair enough, so
he contentedly drove his bull out into the forest, and tied it with a
stout rope to a young tree, whilst he himself wandered aimlessly
about.</p>
<p>Three days later, the fool went to see his beast. It had eaten and
drunk nothing, but had pulled the tree up by the roots, and laid bare a
jar full of old gold coins. The fool was delighted, and played with the
money for a time, then he resolved to take the jar and present it to
the king. As he passed along the road, every wayfarer looked into the
pot, took out the gold in handfuls, and so that he should not notice
their thefts, filled it up with stones and blocks of wood. On reaching
the palace, the fool asked for an audience of the king, and it was
granted. He emptied out the contents of the jar at the feet of the
king. When the courtiers saw the wrath of the king, they took the fool
away and beat him. When he had recovered himself he asked why he had
been thrashed. One of the bystanders, for fun, cried to him: &lsquo;You
have been beaten because you labour <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>in vain.&rsquo; The
fool went his way, muttering the words: &lsquo;You labour in
vain.&rsquo; As he passed a peasant who was reaping, he repeated his
phrase again and again, until the peasant grew angry, and thrashed him.
The fool asked why he had been beaten, and what he ought to have said.
&lsquo;You ought to have said: &ldquo;God give you a good
harvest!&rdquo;&rsquo; The fool went on saying, &lsquo;God give you a
good harvest!&rsquo; and met a funeral. Again he was beaten, and again
he asked what he should say. They replied that he should have said:
&lsquo;Heaven rest your soul!&rsquo; He then came to a wedding, and
saluted the newly-married couple with this funereal phrase. Again he
was beaten, and then told that he should say: &lsquo;Be fruitful and
multiply!&rsquo; His next visit was to a monastery, and he accosted
every monk with his new salutation. They too gave him a thrashing, with
such vigour that the fool determined to have his revenge by stealing
one of the bells from their belfry. So he hid himself until the monks
had gone to rest, and then carried <span class="corr" id="xd21e3742"
title="Source: oft">off</span> a bell of moderate size. He went into
the forest, climbed a tree, and hung the bell on the branches, ringing
it from time to time, partly to amuse himself and partly to frighten
away wild beasts. In the forest there was a gang of robbers, who were
assembled to share their booty, and had just ended a merry banquet.
Suddenly they heard the sound of the bell, and were much afraid. They
took counsel as to what was to be done, and most of them were for
flight, but the oldest of the band advised them to send a scout to see
what was wrong. The bravest among them was sent to get information, and
the rest remained as quiet as possible. The brigand went on tiptoe
through the bushes to the tree where the fool was, and respectfully
asked: &lsquo;Who are you? If you are an angel sent by God to punish
our wickedness, pray spare us <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167"
href="#pb167" name="pb167">167</a>]</span>and we shall repent; if you
are a devil from hell, come and share with us.&rsquo; The fool was not
so stupid that he did not see he had to deal with robbers, so he took
out a knife, tolled the bell, and then said with a grave air: &lsquo;If
you wish to know who I am, climb the tree and show me your tongue, so
that I may mark on it who I am and what I ask of you.&rsquo; The robber
obediently climbed the tree, and put out his tongue as far as he could.
The fool cut off his tongue, and kicked him to the ground. The robber,
mad with pain, and frightened by his sudden fall, ran off howling. His
comrades had come out to meet him, and when they saw the plight he was
in they ran off in terror, leaving their wealth. Next morning the fool
found the booty, and without saying anything to anybody, took it home
and became much richer than his brothers. The fool built three palaces:
one for himself, one for me, and one for you. There is merrymaking in
the fool&rsquo;s palace&mdash;come and be one of the guests!</p>

<p class="first">During a great storm at sea, a learned man heard the
skipper giving his orders, but could not understand a word. When the
danger was past, he asked the skipper in what language he had spoken.
The sailor replied: &lsquo;In my mother tongue, of course!&rsquo; The
scholar expressed his regret that a man should have wasted half his
life without learning to speak grammatically and intelligibly. A few
hours later the storm arose again, and this time the ship sprang a leak
and began to founder. Then the captain went to the scholar and asked if
he could swim. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168"

<h2 class="main">The Story of Dervish</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A hunter killed in the mountains a stag, and began to
skin it. He then hung the skin on a bush, and went down to a stream to
wash the blood from his hands. When he came back, he found to his
surprise that the dead stag had come to life, and was bounding away.
When he had recovered from his astonishment, he chased the beast, but
could not overtake it, and it was soon lost to sight. He met a
wayfarer, briefly told him the story, and asked if he had ever seen a
stag without a skin. &lsquo;I have never seen a stag without a skin,
but I do not wonder at your story. Near here there is a healing spring
where any beast, even if wounded unto death, can be cured by bathing.
Your stag probably bathed there, and is now sound and well. But if you
want to know more about this wonderful country of ours, seek out a man
called Dervish, and he will tell you things that will soon make you
forget all about the stag.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where can I find this
Dervish?&rsquo; asked the hunter. &lsquo;Go from village to village,
and look into every courtyard, and when you see a man smoking a pipe,
with an ass and a she-ass bound before him, ask him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hunter went away, and, after a long search, found Dervish, who
told him the following story:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span></p>
<p>&lsquo;I was married,&rsquo; said Dervish, &lsquo;and loved my wife,
but she deceived me with my next-door neighbour. When I heard of this I
questioned my wife, but, instead of answering, she struck me with a
whip, and, to my horror, I was turned into a dog. My wife drove me out
into the yard, and for shame I ran away. On the road I suffered hunger,
thirst, and despair, and, for the first time in my life, I knew what it
was to be powerless, and realised what a great difference there is
between man and beast. When I opened my mouth and tried to speak, I
only barked and howled. I tried to stand on my hind legs, and walk like
a man, but I fell either backwards or forwards. Then I jumped about,
and did this so easily and briskly that I regained my spirits, and came
to think that even a dog&rsquo;s life had its pleasures. While I was
merrily jumping, I unexpectedly saw a man. He looked at me and I at
him. The man smiled, and I ran up to him, but he was afraid, and lifted
his stick to strike me. We both moved away from each other. I wanted to
speak, but I barked, and the man raised his stick again. I then began
to frolic and jump, and the man smiled again, and let me come up to
him. I understood how dog and man are always the best of friends, and
in my mind I thanked my wicked wife that she had turned me into a dog,
and not some other beast, a pig, for instance. The man who beckoned me
to come to him was a good village priest, and we soon became great
friends. He caressed me, gave me something to eat, and I went away with
him. The kind-hearted priest, overcome by the heat, lay down to rest
under a tree, and I wished to do the same, but the priest said:
&ldquo;Watch over me!&rdquo; so I did not go to sleep, rightly thinking
that if the priest woke and found me asleep he would give me no more
bread, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>perhaps would drive me away. Ah! the beginning
of my dog life was grievous. In the evening, the priest stopped to
sleep with some shepherds who were watching their flocks. The
shepherds, to show honour to their pastor, killed a lamb for supper,
got wine, and made merry. Though I took no direct part in the feast, I
kept close behind my master. After supper, one of the shepherds looked
at me, and said: &ldquo;This dog must be fond of wine, for he never
takes his eyes from the glass, and now and then he licks his
lips.&rdquo; I nodded my head several times. Then the shepherds poured
me out some wine in a plate, and I lapped it up with pleasure. When
they were all asleep, wolves came and attacked the sheep. The
shepherds&rsquo; dogs barked, but did not dare to attack the wolves; I
rose and killed three wolves on the spot. When the shepherds saw this,
they offered the priest a good price for me, and he finally sold me.
Before long I had killed a vast number of wolves, and the fame of me
reached the ears of the king of the country. I was brought and taken to
the palace, to the sick daughter of the king, who was tormented at
night by brownies. Every morning the princess woke exhausted and
enfeebled. On the first night of my watch, I saw swans enter the
bedchamber through the closed doors, they choked and trampled upon the
sleeping princess. I was chained up, and could do nothing to help the
poor maiden. In the morning, I was scolded for not having done
anything, but one of the courtiers defended me, saying: &ldquo;He is a
good dog, but he must be unchained, and then we shall see what he can
do.&rdquo; Next night the swans came again. I killed ten of them, but
the eleventh asked me to spare her, saying she would help me in the
matter of my wife and our neighbour. I trusted the swan, and let her
go. To my delight, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>princess rose healthy and merry
next morning. The king was exceedingly pleased with me, and ordered me
to have a heavy gold chain, and to be fed right royally. I lived well
in the palace, but I longed to see my home and wife again, so I soon
ran away. When I entered my own house, my wife took off my gold chain,
struck me with her whip, and turned me into a duck. I flew into a field
near by, where millet had been sown, and, being inexperienced, was
caught at once in nets laid by a peasant. The peasant took me under his
arm, and gave me to his wife, telling her to cook me for dinner. As
soon as the peasant had gone out, the woman looked at me intently, and
then took down from the wall a whip, with which she struck me, and
turned me into a man again, saying: &ldquo;Have I helped you or not? We
were twelve sisters, you killed ten of us, I am the eleventh, and your
wife is the twelfth. Now go home, take the whip which hangs over your
wife&rsquo;s bed, strike her and your neighbour with it, and you can
turn them into any kind of beasts that you wish.&rdquo; I went in late
at night, when my wife and the neighbour were both asleep, I struck
them with the whip, and turned my wife into an ass, and the man into a
she-ass, and here they are.&rsquo; The hunter was terrified when he
heard this story of Dervish, he ran away from the enchanted mountain
realm as fast as he could, and resolved never to go back there
again.</p>

<p class="first">A certain man was wont to tell his son, while
thrashing him, that he would never come to any good. The boy grew tired

to the rank of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=

where his father lived. On his way to his post, the new pasha stopped
at a place twenty miles off, and said to the Bashi-Bazouks of his
guard: &lsquo;Ride to such and such a village, seize so and so, and
bring him to me.&rsquo; The Bashi-Bazouks arrived at night, dragged the
sick old man out of bed, and took him to the pasha. The pasha stretched
himself to his full height, and, ordering the old man to look him in
the face, said: &lsquo;Do you know me?&rsquo; The old man fixed his
gaze on the pasha, and cried: &lsquo;Ah, pasha! you are surely my
son.&rsquo; &lsquo;Did you not tell me in my boyhood that I should
never come to any good? Now look at me,&rsquo; and the pasha pointed to
his epaulets. &lsquo;Well, was I wrong? You are no man, but only a
pasha. What man worthy the name would send for his father in the way
you have done? I repeat it, you have gained the rank of pasha, but you
have not become a good man.&rsquo;</p>

<h2 class="main">The Hermit Philosopher</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was once a wise man who loved solitude, and
dwelt far away from other men, meditating on the vanities of the world.
He spent nearly all his time in the open air, and he could easily do
this, for he lived in a lovely southern land where there is no winter
and but little rain. As he wandered once among the verdure of his
garden, the sage stopped before an aged walnut tree covered with
ripening nuts, and said: &lsquo;Why is there such a strange want of
symmetry in nature? Here, for instance, is a walnut tree a hundred
years old, hiding its top in the clouds, and yet how small is its
fruit: itself it grows from year to year, but its fruit is always of
the same size. Now, on the beds <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173"
href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>at the foot of the tree there
grow great pumpkins and melons on very small creeping plants. It would
be more fitting if the pumpkins grew on the walnut trees and the
walnuts on the pumpkin beds. Why this want of symmetry in
nature?&rsquo; The sage thought deeply on the subject, and walked in
the garden for a long time, till at last he felt sleepy. He lay down
under the shady walnut tree, and was soon slumbering peacefully. In a
short time, he felt a slight blow on the face, then a second, and then
a third. As he opened his eyes, a ripe walnut fell on his nose. The
sage leaped to his feet, and said: &lsquo;Now I understand the secret
of nature. If this tree had borne melons or pumpkins, my head would
have been broken. Henceforth let no one presume to find fault with
Providence!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="first">The counsellor of an Arabian king once bethought
himself that, though he had lived so many years, and knew so much, he
had never yet found out how much the king valued his services, and to
what extent his wife and friends really loved him. He decided to try
them all at once, so he went to the palace and stole a goat of which
the king was very fond, and of which he was the keeper. He then went
home, told this secret to his wife, and in her presence ordered the
cook to roast the goat. But afterwards he privately told the cook to
hide the royal goat, and roast a kid in its place. At supper his wife
praised the dish <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174"
name="pb174">174</a>]</span>very highly. As soon as the king heard of
the loss of his goat, he was very angry, and cried in his wrath:
&lsquo;If any man finds the thief I shall load him with gold, if a
woman finds him I shall marry her!&rsquo; The counsellor&rsquo;s wife,
thinking it better to be a king&rsquo;s wife, betrayed her husband. The
king ordered his counsellor to be executed, and married the woman. When
the execution was about to take place, the victim&rsquo;s old friends
succeeded in saving him by a large bribe, and another criminal was
executed instead. The counsellor was hidden in a neighbouring realm.
Some years afterwards, troublesome questions of state arose, and none
of the council could solve them. The king often longed for his old
counsellor, and said: &lsquo;For the sake of a goat I sacrificed a
clever man, if he were alive he would get me out of all my trouble in a
day.&rsquo; The counsellor&rsquo;s old friends at last resolved to
acknowledge the trick they had played. So one day, when the king was in
a good humour, they went and said: &lsquo;Pardon us, O king! Your first
counsellor is alive!&rsquo; and they told him all. The king was
heartily glad, and ordered the exile to be brought back. He was well
received, and restored the goat to the king. The king said: &lsquo;My
friend! we thus see that the greatest scourge of all is false witness,
and that we must beware, above all things, of our wives.&rsquo;</p>

the groom might come neither on Monday nor Tuesday, Wednesday nor
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, nor Sunday, but on any other day of the
